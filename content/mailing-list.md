Beyond our normal community avenues where you can get to know about and have discussions on hacking, technical topics or our events, we also maintain a mailing list. The list has postings on our events, interesting technical opportunities, job postings, hackathons and competitions, and more! 

If you would like to be in the loop for these opportunities, **join our mailing list [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/nushackers) if you have a Google account**.

### Joining the mailing list without a Google account

If you do not have a Google account, the process signing up for the mailing list is different. Follow the steps below:

* Send an email to [nushackers+subscribe@googlegroups.com](mailto:nushackers+subscribe@googlegroups.com). Any subject and email content works.
* Reply to the email received from [nushackers+subconfirm@googlegroups.com](mailto:nushackers+subconfirm@googlegroups.com). Again, any subject and email content works. **Do not click the "Join This Group" button**.

To interact with our community through other avenues or keep up-to-date with what we are doing, [take a look here](http://localhost:1313/community/).
