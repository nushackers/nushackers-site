<h3>Talk 1: Rapid Prototyping with PHP - The world of TDD, BDD and frameworks in PHP-land (Michael Cheng, Senior Software Engineer at mig33)</h3>
<strong>Talk Description:</strong>
A quick overview of the state of modern day PHP development in the real world. An introduction of frameworks available and some nifty tricks and best practices you need to make it in a rapidly changing startup environment.

<strong>Speaker Profile:</strong>
Michael Cheng has more than 10 years of experience using PHP to build dynamic websites. He is the convener of the Singapore PHP User Group and a Zend Certified Engineer/Trainer in PHP development.

Michael is currently a Senior Software Engineer with a local mid-sized startup called mig33 - a social entertainment platform - that's popular in emerging economies like Indonesia and Nepal.
<h3>Talk 2: Clojure - The Return of The Lisp (Omer Iqbal, NUS Student)</h3>
<strong>Talk Description:</strong>
Clojure combines the elegance of lisp with strong pragmatism. Its one of the few functional programming languages, along with Haskell, Erlang and Scala that have managed to crawl to the industry, and that's primarily because of its brilliant concurrency primitives, seamless interop with Java and very friendly community.

I'll be giving a whirlwind tour of the language, covering the basic syntax (which is minimal, by virtue of being a lisp!), java interop, a few concurrency primitives, macros, writing a simple web server using Ring, and making some live noise with Overtone.

<strong>Prep:</strong>
No need to prepare, but I'll be doing some live coding and it would help to install leiningen 2.x(https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen) if you want to join in the action. Lein is a dependency manager, a build tool, and an awesome fire exhaust when your hair ignites after classpath errors.

<strong>Speaker Profile:</strong>
Omer loves Koolaid, and the effects last for a while on him. His interests include web dev, embedded systems, cheap coffee (from the Koufu drinks stall!) and flamewars.
