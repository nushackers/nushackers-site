<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Date/Time:</strong> Friday, Aug 30 at 6:30pm
<strong>Venue:</strong> SR2, Education Resource Centre, University Town. Map: <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/2Zy3M">http://goo.gl/maps/2Zy3M</a>
<strong>Free pizza is served before the talks.</strong></p>

<h3>Talk: How I am stalking you – the NUS LDAP directory (Fazli Sapuan – Student)</h3>
<strong>Talk Description:</strong>
Fazli will talk about the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), a technology from 1993 still in popular use by enterprises and other organizations like NUS. He will be showcasing his web app which has the ability to perform a student lookup search and list information about the student such as the course and year, the modules being read and the location of his residence in campus. The source code of the app will be published for the NUS hacking community.

<strong>Speaker Profile:</strong>
Fazli likes to hack random projects for fun and without any apparent reason. He doesn't like to talk about security hacking, but if he has to then he is a self-proclaimed grey hat. Fazli believes that what he did here does not constitute as security "hacking", and that the app was not unethical in any form. Fazli is awesome. He totally did not write this blog post, Wordpress is lying.
<h3>About Lightning Talks</h3>
NUS Hackers is currently transitioning from weekly tech talks to a more community-involved format. As such, we are currently experimenting with new ideas. The new ideas may or may not work but the plan is we will always have something familiar to fall back on even if they fail.

More information about the lighting talks will be available later.
