It’s the last Friday Hacks of the semester, and we’ll be doing something different this time. Instead of the usual talks, we’ll be having a programming challenge this week, with a twist - shortest solutions win!

### Code Golf

This week’s Friday Hacks is something different – instead of talks, we’ll be having a Code Golf session! Take a break from content-heavy talks and forget your programming languages’ best practices. See how well you know your favourite languages and pit your skills against other attendees!

We’ll be making use of GitHub to run the challenge, so be sure to create a GitHub account at github.com before you arrive!

You’ll be allowed to use your favourite programming language. Further challenge details will be revealed on the day itself!

### Semester Afterparty

Come celebrate the end of this semester with us! There will be free beer after the code golf. On us :)
