# Engaging with the tech community beyond school

How can a student engage with the technology industry beyond school? This talk will scan through practical tips for getting started online and getting involved with projects. What communities can you join easily and learn? Which meetups can you attend and even help to co-organize? How to start contributing to open source? Can we easily share with by writing our own blogs, books or even making podcasts? What are some interesting social media accounts or blogs to follow? How can we add in short trips to engage with locals while traveling anywhere in the world? We will discuss all these questions and more!
