Wee~

It's been a busy week with midterms and all, hope everybody's been doing well?

We're pleased to announce our first social meetup session next Tuesday, 9 Oct, at 6pm , at the linuxNUS Clubroom at SoC #03-19.

Do feel free to come by, after all, the Clubroom is where it all happens for linuxNUS! As members, you'll also have access to the linuxNUS Library, a collection of technical manuals contributed by members of our community. There is also spare hardware on which you can use to test various software packages if you so wish.

Hope to see you there on Tuesday!

Cheers
linuxNUS Coreteam
