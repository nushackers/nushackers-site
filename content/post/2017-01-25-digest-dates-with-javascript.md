This post is about the various ways you can create a `Date` in JavaScript,
both documented and undocumented, how it works under the hood, and the (maybe surprising) results you get.

I first came across this while working on [NUSMods](http://v3.nusmods.com) and [Flow](https://flowtype.org) warned that passing an array of values to `Date` is not valid.
However if you actually try it, say in `node` interpreter or in your browser's console, it works:

```
new Date([2016, 8, 8])
> Mon Aug 08 2016 00:00:00 GMT+0800 (SGT)
```

And indeed, this is not a specified way of constructing a `Date` - you don't see it in [MDN reference for `Date`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date).

However, my code still ran fine. And when I tried to change it to use multiple arguments instead, the result was different:

```
new Date(2016, 8, 8)
> Thu Sep 08 2016 00:00:00 GMT+0800 (SGT)
```

Notice how it is Sep now instead of Aug.

But if I passed in a string, it works as expected:
```
new Date('2016, 8, 8')
> Mon Aug 08 2016 00:00:00 GMT+0800 (SGT)
```

This led to me investigating how the `Date` constructor works.

## Creating a `Date`

> The information below comes from this very informative [MDN reference on `Date`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date)

Creating a `Date` looks pretty straightforward in JavaScript, you call the constructor with the `new` keyword - `new Date()`.

There are 4 specified ways, of varying convenience, that you can call the constructor.

1. No arguments, gives you the current time: `new Date()`

2. Integer value (really a number) - treated as milliseconds since epoch (1 January 1970 00:00:00 UTC): `new Date(1483372800000)`

3. String representing a date - parsed by `Date.parse()`: `new Date('2017-01-03')`

4. Multiple number arguments - minimally requires a year and month, but you can specify up to 7 (extra arguments are ignore): `new Date(2017, 0, 3)`


## An aside on months

If we read the reference in more detail, we can understand why this happens:

```
new Date(2016, 8, 8)
> Thu Sep 08 2016 00:00:00 GMT+0800 (SGT)
```

> month
>
> Integer value representing the month, beginning with 0 for January to 11 for December.

So 8 is treated as the 9th month, which is Sep.


How about the case when we pass in a string?

```
new Date(Date.parse('2016, 8, 8'))
> Mon Aug 08 2016 00:00:00 GMT+0800 (SGT)
```

The month is treated more naturally, in this case 8 is parsed as August.

So what's left is the case when an `array` is passed into `Date`.

## Creating Dates with every possible type

It helps to first examine the data types in JavaScript,
and pass each of them to `Date` to see what happens.

There are 6 types:
- `number`
- `string`
- `null`
- `undefined`
- `boolean`
- `object` (an `array` is an `object`)

An `integer` in JavaScript is really a `double` (`number` type):

```
(new Date(10)).valueOf()
> 10
(new Date(10.9)).valueOf()
> 10
```

> we use valueOf to get the milliseconds represented by the date (which is also how `Date` is implemented)

Seems like a `double` is rounded down.

Passing `null` and `boolean` seem to give us the same effect as passing `0`:

```
(new Date(0)).valueOf()
> 0
(new Date(null)).valueOf()
> 0
(new Date(false)).valueOf()
> 0
(new Date(true)).valueOf()
> 0
```

How about `undefined`?

```
(new Date(undefined))
> Invalid Date
(new Date(undefined)).valueOf()
> NaN
```

It sets the internal value of `Date` to `NaN`.

And the same goes for an `object`:

```
(new Date({})).valueOf()
> NaN
```

However, when we pass in an `array` (which is an `object`), even with just 1 value, we get a perhaps surprising result:

```
new Date([0])
> Sat Jan 01 2000 00:00:00 GMT+0800 (SGT)
```

## Arrays, primitive value, and default value

So what's going on? A quick Google search turned up this [StackOverflow result](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11291206/passing-an-array-to-the-javascript-date-constructor-is-it-standard).

The answer mentions something about converting the argument into a primitive value by calling an internal method called `[[DefaultValue]]`,
which converts the array into a string.

I like how concise the article is, but I also felt that it will be instructive to dig deeper into the spec and also the source code.

The relevant part of the ES5 spec is section [15.9.3.2](http://es5.github.io/#x15.9.3.2).
It describes what to do when a single argument is passed to the Date constructor.

> 1. Let v be `ToPrimitive(value)`

The first step is to convert the input to a primitive value using `ToPrimitive`, which behavior is detailed in section [9.1](http://es5.github.io/#x9.1) of the same spec.

![Section 9.1 of ES5 Spec - ToPrimitive Conversions](/img/2017/01/es5-9-1-toprimitive-conversions.png)

Of the 6 types mentioned above, only `Object` is not a primitive value. So it needs be converted.

An `array` in JavaScript is really an `object`, so this falls to the last case in the table, which is to "Return a default value for the Object" by calling `[[DefaultValue]]`.
This is also detailed in the spec in section [8.12.8](http://es5.github.io/#x8.12.8).

The description slightly more involved than what we've seen, so in short, the `[[DefaultValue]]` of an `array` is the result of calling `toString()` on the `array`.

```
[0].toString()
> "0"
```

So what really happened was that when we passed `[0]` to Date, it is first converted to the string `"0"`, and this falls into case 3 of creating a Date.
`"0"` is successfully parsed into a Date which gives us Jan 1st of 2000.

We can verify that this is the case:

```
(new Date([0])).valueOf() === (new Date('0')).valueOf()
> true
```

So now we have an answer to the original example:

```
[2016, 8, 8].toString()
> "2016,8,8"

> new Date([2016, 8, 8])
Mon Aug 08 2016 00:00:00 GMT+0800 (SGT)

> new Date([2016, 8, 8].toString())
Mon Aug 08 2016 00:00:00 GMT+0800 (SGT)

(new Date([2016, 8, 8])).valueOf() === (new Date('2016,8,8')).valueOf()
> true
```

## Implementation

I also wanted to see how the implementation is like so I went around digging.
I thought I could find this in `V8`, but I only found a [`date.cc`](https://github.com/v8/v8/blob/master/src/date.cc) that didn't seem to implement the Date constructor.

Digging a bit more led me to [`builtins-date.cc`](https://github.com/v8/v8/blob/master/src/builtins/builtins-date.cc#L203), which is basically what is called when
we write `new Date()` in JavaScript.

Here you can see the checks for the number of arguments, as well as calling `Object::ToPrimitive` on the value, and then parsing it if it is a `string`.

Looking around a bit more, I stumbled upon a test file in `node`, [`date-constructor.js`](https://github.com/v8/v8/blob/master/test/webkit/date-constructor.js#L75),
which mentions a [WebKit bug](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=26978),
that led me to look into WebKit.

This has a similar implementation to V8, in [`DateConstructor.cpp`](https://github.com/WebKit/webkit/blob/master/Source/JavaScriptCore/runtime/DateConstructor.cpp#L156).

> Slight aside on modern JavaScript engines: V8 is the JavaScript engine that powers chrome (and node), whereas WebKit uses JavaScriptCore, which is what powers Safari.

And if you're willing to dig deeper, you can figure out how `toPrimitive` is implemented starting from [`builtins-conversion.cc`](https://github.com/v8/v8/blob/f1441384ff3800885e5c6f074656bf8806986ff4/src/builtins/builtins-conversion.cc#L28) in V8 and [`JSObject.cpp`](https://github.com/WebKit/webkit/blob/b7d2a175887b03a34713bd86e545f3133f616018/Source/JavaScriptCore/runtime/JSObject.cpp#L1962) in WebKit.

But for now, my `Date` with JavaScript is over.
