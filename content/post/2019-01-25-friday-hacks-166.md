### Encoding Images in Source 1 with Minimal Tokens

#### Talk Description:

We discuss how to encode and decode arbitrary colour images in a sublanguage of JavaScript called Source, used in CS1101S, the introductory programming module that all SoC CS freshmen take. Source 1 is a very limited subset of JavaScript, used as a teaching aid to avoid overwhelming those new to programming. It contains only pure functions and primitive operations; even the string methods are unavailable. In CS1101S, there is a competition where students write code that generates an image, using some provided helper functions. The score of each entry is determined by the number of votes, but there is a penalty based on the number of tokens in the code.

#### Speaker Profile

Uriel is a year 1 computer science student who took CS1101S in the previous semester. He is interested in algorithms and also does some hardware projects in his free time.
