## 1) NUSMods - What's Next?

**NUSMods** started as a better way for students to plan their school timetables. Over time, features have been added to improve the lives of NUS students. We will share how we built NUSMods, present a high level overview of its architecture, share the exciting features planned for NUSMods V4, and give tips on how to contribute.
