## 1) Security-as-Code: Building our way to better security outcomes

Despite our best efforts, we can’t hack our way to better security if we don’t solve problems at their root causes. However, long compliance checklists isn’t the way forward either. How can we apply software engineering to solve security problems? This talk will discuss various security products such as access control tooling, secure-by-default application components, and guardrails for developers. If you’re interested in both software engineering and security and wanted to learn how to use both, this is the talk for you!

## 2) Continuations: Five minutes to learn, a lifetime to understand

The title assumes that the audience has five minutes.  We will then go from there.
