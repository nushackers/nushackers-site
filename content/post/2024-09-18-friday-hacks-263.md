## 1) Lessons Learned from 2 Decades of Open Source

In this talk I want to share my experience in open source, how it affected me in my capacity as a programmer and what lessons I learned (both technical and non-technical).

### Speaker Profile 🎙️

I'm a professional Haskell developer and an avid open source enthusiast. I am from Germany and have been living in Singapore for the past two years. My biggest open source contribution has been the GHCup Haskell installer. I'm also on the Haskell core libraries committee.<br /><br />

👋 See you there!
