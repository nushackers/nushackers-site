### How Fluminu(r)s was Built

#### Talk Description:

Fluminus and Fluminurs are CLI tools to automate downloading files from LumiNUS, the new learning management system that NUS uses to replace IVLE. Unlike IVLE, there is no open, easily accessible API available to students. This talk will describe how I built Fluminus and Fluminurs in spite of this limitation.

Space Out seeks to provide timely information and past trends on crowd levels to assist people in choosing where to go for a variety of retail and recreation purposes, so as to promote safe distancing amidsts the Covid-19 situation. This was also to support operators in better managing the crowd levels at their premises, as well as to facilitate more evenly-distributed crowds across different facilities.
