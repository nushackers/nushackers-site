Greetings, fellow hackers.

Coming Good Friday (6th April), we have two talks by Abishek and Andy. Despite it being a public holiday, our Friday Hacks will go on unimpeded and because it is Good Friday, we are giving away a free ergonomic keyboard (worth $80), that will ensure you aren't limited by your hands getting tired after long hours of coding :P (You need to register to be eligible to win the keyboard and of course you must also be present at the Friday Hacks to qualify for this).

<strong>Talk 1:</strong>
"Ruby for Soul of Data Nerds" by Abishek Parolkar

<strong>Talk Details:</strong>
The term BigData is associated to anything where scale of the data is part of the problem. Today's internet companies (Youtube,Facebook,ViKi etc) face challenges surrounding analysis and management of this data.
In this talk Abhishek is going to show you how people solved these problems and built analytics systems all with Ruby and related technologies.

<strong>Talk 2:</strong>
"Erlang... and you thought Ericsson only made phones!" by Andy Marks

<strong>Talk Details:</strong>
Erlang is a programming language used to build massively scalable soft real-time systems with requirements on high availability. Some of its uses are in telecoms, banking, e-commerce, computer telephony and instant messaging. Erlang's runtime system has built-in support for concurrency, distribution and fault tolerance. It was designed by Ericsson to support distributed, fault-tolerant, soft-real-time, non-stop applications. It supports hot swapping, so that code can be changed without stopping a system.
