## 1) Vite, Rust, and the future of JavaScript tooling
Despite being the world's most widely used language, the JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem has long been fragmented. Unlike Rust, which has an official tool like Cargo for most workflows, JS devs rely on dozens of 3rd-party dependencies just to start a project. Vite drastically simplified the frontend workflow, and now at Void(0), we're building a Rust-based unified toolchain to do the same for the entire JS ecosystem. In this talk, we’ll discuss JS’s evolution, why we think it's time to challenge the status quo, and our progress so far.

### Speaker Profile 🎙️️
Evan You is renowned as the creator of Vue.js, a popular open-source JavaScript framework, and Vite, a modern web development build tool. He is also the founder of VoidZero, which focuses on building the next generation of toolchains for JavaScript and TypeScript.<br /><br />

## 2) How to move terabytes of data around 🎙️
In this talk, Herbert will demonstrate how modern big data pipelines are designed to efficiently ingest, process, transform, and distribute massive volumes of data, ranging from terabytes (TBs) to even petabytes (PBs).

### Speaker Profile 🎙️

Herbert is a software engineer at Allium, which provides on-chain data infrastructure products. He previously built data pipelines and machine learning models at Basis AI, Jump Trading, Twitter. <br /><br />

👋 See you there!
