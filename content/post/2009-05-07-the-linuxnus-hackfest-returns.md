This Saturday, linuxNUS is going to have another hackfest. The last time we had one, projects involving Java, PHP, Python and even Mobile Processing were being worked on by all the different people who attended. Ideas were tossed around, and conversations about iPhone, Android and open source events in Singapore were in full swing, among others. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ruiwen/sets/72157617001011319/">See the photos!</a>

What's a hackfest about, you ask? Well, anything a geek wants, a geek gets. Power, Wi-Fi, good coffee... no rules, no expectations, except have a good time and hack away.

Keep watching this site for more details such as place and time ... or pop on by <a href="http://linuxnus.org/irc">#linuxnus</a> to ask!

Do join us this weekend!
