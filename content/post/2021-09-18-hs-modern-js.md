**Date/Time:** Saturday, 2 Oct 2021, 10am &ndash; 12pm<br />
**Venue:** Online on Zoom

Come learn modern JavaScript, the language that powers the web, on both the client- and server-side. We'll go through basic syntax and object-oriented programming and classes in JavaScript, and then talk about the event loop, promises, and async/await. You will get a solid foundation in the language that will pave the way for you to learn any JavaScript frontend or backend framework and write your own modern webapps.

**Prior basic programming knowledge in any language is assumed.** If you attended our prior workshops on Python, you should be all set.
