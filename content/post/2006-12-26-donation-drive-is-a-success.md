Wee!! Despite the lack of heavy publicity and the very short notice, we still managed to collect $100. Many thanks to:

Mei Hua: $5.00
Kevin: $10.00
Ruiwen: $15.00
Junhao: $20.00
Lu Feng: $20.00
Rey: $20.00 + 10% of total sum

We bought the foodstuff at Cold Storage (Ngee Ann City) as it is a very central location and has a gigantic donation booth right in front of the shopping mall. =)

In total we donated 60kg of rice,  2 big tins of Ovaltine, and 5 big boxes of cereals. Lu Feng has the receipt, so he should be posting the exact prices soon. =)

Thank you everyone!

Update: We bought 60kg of rice for SG$64.75, 3kg of Ovaltine for SG$18.10, 400g of Kelloggs H/Flakes for SG$4.75, 340g of Oreo cereals for SG$4.40, 368g of Cocoa Crunch for SG$4.20, 368g of Fruity Pebbles for SG$4.20. Total cost is SG$100.40. You can see the <a href="/img/2006/12/lf_receipt.JPG">receipt</a> if you want
