<strong>The Singapore Linux March Meetup (Open Source Alliance - Software Freedom Day)</strong>

<em>Location</em>

<em>Singapore Management University

Bras Basah Road
SIS Networked Seminar Rm 2.4
Singapore </em>

This month SLMG would like to introduce FOSA and talk about goals of the society, discuss the proposed constitution and to identify members who would like to hold office during the initial formation. During this time we would like to get your feedback on the progress so far.

Software Freedom Day (SFD)
Last years Software Freedom day was a great success, considering that it was done totally with volunteers and a tiny budget. We hope to do the same this year and make it a bigger and more successful SFD. We will discuss what we would like to achieve this year and take your suggestions for improvement.

Hope to see you all there,

Tom

PS. Mario Behling from LXDE is still in Singapore and he will be at this event.

For anyone interested he is willing to discuss about forming a team to work on the <a href="http://lxde.org/">LXDE</a> version of <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>. This will be officially recognised by <a href="http://www.canonical.com/">Canonical</a>.

So do be there if you wish to discuss with him how you can be part of the  team. Both technical and non technical contributors are required, but willingness to contribute and to learn actively is key. Mario hopes to form a Singapore team for this project.
