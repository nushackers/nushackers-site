Come learn how to manipulate, process, search, and make sense of any form of data with various tools, all while never leaving the Unix command line.

Please ensure you have access to a POSIX-compatible shell, such as Bash. If you are on macOS or a Linux distribution, you are set; if you use Windows, consider installing Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) or Ubuntu in VirtualBox.

This workshop is largely based on the Missing Semester of Your CS Education lecture series conducted in MIT. This week's topic is based on <https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/shell-tools/>.
