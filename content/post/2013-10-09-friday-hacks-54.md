<h3>Talk: Into the Deep (Blue) - Computer Chess (Fazli Sapuan - NUS Student)</h3>
<strong>Talk Description:</strong>
The theory of computer chess has been explored as early as 1948, but it was not until 1951 when Alan Turing developed (on paper) the first program capable of playing a full game of chess. Since then, computer scientists have made great strides over the decades; most historically, then-reigning chess world champion Garry Kasparov was defeated in 1997 by an IBM supercomputer named "Deep Blue".

This talk will cover general computer A.I. theory and the internals of a modern computer chess engine. And also, more specifically, how the widespread adoption of 64-bit datapaths in commodity-grade computers was able to boost the performance of chess engines. Finally, the talk will also cover the interfaces developed for chess engines and how you can use such interface to develop your own chess application.

<strong>Speaker Profile:</strong>
Fazli likes to hack random projects for fun and without any apparent reason. Fazli has made <em>super cool</em> chess software such as <a href="//vulpine.fuzzie.sg">Vulpine</a>, a chess GUI, and <a href="//cc.fuzzie.sg">Cloud Chess</a>, a high performance online chess A.I. app. Fazli feels writing in third-person is really weird.
