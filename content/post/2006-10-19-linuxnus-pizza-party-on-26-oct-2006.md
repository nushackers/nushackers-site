Dear linuxNUS friends,

With all the CAs and assignments during these few weeks, I am sure many of us are really in need of a break. With this in mind, linuxNUS is organising a pizza party in our clubroom (at SoC 1 Level 3) on <span style="font-weight: bold">26 Oct 2006 at 6.15pm</span>. The idea is to have an evening of relaxation and casual chatter about our upcoming plans.

We will also be unveiling our T-Shirt design for the linuxNUS community.

Tentatively, the idea is for a pizza party, but do feel free to reply to this mail if you have any suggestions about what else we can have for dinner, as well as the venue.

Kindly email us to let us know if you are coming. Please RSVP by 25 Oct 06 so that we can make appropriate F&B arrangements. The point of contact for this meetup is Lu Feng (HP: 91292492).

We look forward to meeting all of you.
