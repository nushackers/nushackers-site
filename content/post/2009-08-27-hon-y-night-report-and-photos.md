HoN was certainly fun. We even had icedwater joining us all the way from Germany. We had some real intense matches and a good late night supper at Holland Village. And one thing for sure is, gaming is certainly a good way for team bonding :)

We already had one adhoc match over the weekend, arranged via IRC. So hang around in <a href="http://linuxnus.org/irc/">our IRC channel</a> if you are looking for HoN beginners :p We should be arranging another games night in the near future. So keep your eyes open for our next event.

Here are some photos of this HoN-y night.
