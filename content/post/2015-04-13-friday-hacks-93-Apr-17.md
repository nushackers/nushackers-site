### Teleport, an Intelligent Routing Service

Teleport is MyRepublic's intelligent routing service - a hassle-free,
device-free and cost-free way of allowing subscribers to experience the
Internet it was meant to be enjoyed: smooth and without restrictions. Find out

20 years of experience to bear in seeking innovative solutions in the
ever-changing Internet landscape.

### Functional Programming from First Principles
 
#### Talk description

We've heard a number of talks this semester on functional programming
languages such as Elixir and Scala. These languages are large and complicated,
which makes it difficult to understand the essence of functional programming.

Church's Lambda Calculus is the oldest and simplest possible functional
programming language. It has the following syntax:

```<var> ::= a | b | ... | z```

```<exp> ::= <var> | (\<var> <exp>) | (<exp> <exp>)```

In this talk, we will explore Church's Lambda Calculus via a series of demos
based on Tromp's 2012 IOCCC winning entry: http://www.ioccc.org/2012/tromp/hint.html 
An unobfuscated version of the above is available at https://github.com/melvinzhang/binary-lambda-calculus and will be used for the demos in this talk.
