Hi everyone!

We'll be having a joint event with NES (the NUS Entrepreneurship Society) this Saturday (24th March 2012), as an experiment to see how many hackers we can inspire to work in or start a startup.

<strong>Time: </strong>9.30am - 1pm
<strong>Location:</strong> HSS Auditorium

The context is web/tech startups, and the theme is: 'here's how I did it; you can do it too.' We're getting some hacker-founders, and NES has gotten some business-founders (all if them from tech startups) to come share their stories, and the format is TED-style 20 minute talks. After that everyone may approach the speakers and talk to them, one-on-one. And free lunch is provided. :)

We have four speakers:
<ul><li><strong>Lee Min Xuan</strong>, co-founder of PlayMoolah</li>
<li><strong>Meng Weng Wong</strong>, VC at JFDI, Perl hacker, founder Karmasphere, pobox, co-author of RFC4408 Sender Policy Framework</li>
<li><strong>Chavy Goh</strong>, founder of Saxxom</li>
<li><strong>Wong Hoong An</strong>, co-founder of HungryGoWhere</li></ul>

Register here:

It's always good to come meet these people and make contacts, in case you decide to do a startup in the future. ;-)

I hope to see you there!

Warmly,
Ced

PS: Our goal in this scenario is to build up to a stage where we can do Startup School, similar to what YCombinator does in the Valley - <a href="http://startupschool.org/">http://startupschool.org/</a>

We're not sure if this is a good idea yet, so we're doing this small-scale event as a data gathering exercise. If you like free food, TED-style inspiring talks and some mingling with hackers who have started companies, do drop by and support this. :) 

PPS: Feedback, post-event, is much welcomed.
