From our <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/linuxNUS/message/4183">mailing list archive</a>:
<blockquote>The Free and Open Source Alliance (<a href="FOSA.sg">FOSA.sg</a>) would like to invite you  to take part in Software Freedom Day Singapore 2009. We have a number of events lined up for you next month on September 18 and 19 at the Singapore Management University, Bras Basah and the National Library Building, Bugis, and we hope you'll be able to join in.

We'll have events all day on both days. On Friday (September 18),  we'll be organizing a series of talks at the NLB, providing an overview of setting up and using free and open source software in  business, government and education, aimed primarily at a non-technical audience. Saturday (September 19) will see two simultaneous events: at SMU, we'll have tutorial sessions on the use of open source tools and techniques, aimed specifically at a technical audience. At the same time, we'll have booths set up at the National Library Building's plaza to introduce members of the public to the benefits of open source, the wide range of powerful, reliable tools available for free, and to the participants, both companies and groups, involved in the open source community in Singapore. Event overviews are available at <a href="http://softwarefreedomday.sg/">http://softwarefreedomday.sg/ </a>; detailed schedules will online as soon as they're ready.</blockquote>
So this year it is going to be more grand than the previous year because it is going to be held at NLB :)

linuxNUS definitely wants to be part of the action for SFD 2009. So a few of us did a quick brainstorm in <a href="http://linuxnus.org/irc/">IRC</a>, and we came out with the following ideas:
<ul>
	<li>Showcase Compiz-Fusion</li>
	<li>Play our podcasts</li>
	<li>Setup some multiplayer FOSS games: Note need lots of manpower and resource... to be done only if there is sufficient manpower.</li>
	<li>Check with ComCen and Mozilla@NUS team on their involvement with Open Source</li>
	<li>Showcase what linuxNUS has been doing over the past few years to promote the cause in NUS</li>
</ul>
Currently, we already have a small ad-hoc team to get things moving. But more heads are definitely better than the few we have. So if you have any ideas, or would like to contribute to the linuxNUS' SFD booth in terms of resources or manpower, please post in the comments :D
