This week's Friday Hacks would be held at Seminar Room 3, at UTown Education Resource Centre. We don't have a speaker booked, so if you'd like to give an informal talk please leave us a note at the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/nushackers?hl=en_US">mailing list</a>. 

<strong>Full Details:</strong>

<blockquote><strong>Location:</strong> UTown, Education Resource Center, 2nd floor, Seminar Room 2
<strong>Time:</strong> 7pm-10pm
Agenda: Weekly Hackathon, as usual. :)</blockquote>

As a reminder: LadyPy would be held in the room next to ours. So if you have Python kungfu and you'd like to help, just drop by. See you there!
