## 1) Achieving 100% Eva Synchro: Enhancing Enterprise Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity offensive and defensive teams are often at odds with each other due to conflicting goals. In this talk, I will elaborate on what exactly these teams do in practice and show how security teams can work together to improve enterprise security.

### Speaker Profile üéôÔ∏è

Hui Yi wears many hats at TikTok, supporting both offensive and defensive cybersecurity operations, as well as occasional application development. In recent times, she has chosen to focus more on the defensive side of the house in order to pay back the sins incurred from scarring the blue team too much. Outside of work, she plays Chinese instruments, and plays the most boring simulation games in the world.<br /><br />

## 2) Introduction to Open-RMF

Open-RMF (Robotics Middleware Framework) is an open-source interoperability framework that facilitates the integration and coordination of multiple robot fleets and infrastructure systems in shared spaces. It offers a consolidated platform for fleet management, conflict resolution and task allocation for various robot types in dynamic environments. This session will introduce core components of Open-RMF, highlight real-world use cases, and guide users to integrate their own robot fleets with the framework.

### Speaker Profile üéôÔ∏è

Xiyu is a software engineer on the Open Robotics team at Intrinsic, bringing 3 years of experience, focusing on Open-RMF. She deployed mobile robot fleets and  is a key contributor to the project's open-source repo, implementing fleet adapters and integrating building infrastructure to the Open-RMF framework.<br /><br />

üëã See you there!
