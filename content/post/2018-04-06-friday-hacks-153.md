### Chit-chat with Coreteam

#### Talk Description:

Hey Hackers! Ever wondered who exactly are the coreteam of NUS Hackers? Ever feel that you've never got the opportunity to speak with us? For Friday Hacks this week we'll be having something a little different! Come hang with us at the hangar (no pun intended) and we'll share a little about ourselves and some of the projects we've been working on. This Friday Hacks is for us to get to know you guys and vice versa!

#### Speaker Profile

NUS Hackers is a student-run organization committed to the spread of hacker culture & free/open-source software. We provide a support system for hackers in NUS who are currently building things (be it for charity, business or pleasure). We also hold workshops, run technical meetups, organize hackathons, and maintain open source code for the NUS community.
