### Welcome Tea

#### Talk Description:

Welcome back to Friday Hacks!

We will be sharing about what we do and the importance of fostering hacker culture in NUS. We will also overview the events we have lined up for the upcoming academic year and how you can get involved in helping us spread the joy of hacking!

As usual, free pizza will be served. All freshmen and current students from all faculties, as well as anyone else who is interested, are welcome to attend.

Please RSVP at our Facebook Event [here](https://www.facebook.com/events/473358153498887/) if you are coming so we know how many people to cater for.

See you there!
