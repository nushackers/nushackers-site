### Project traintraintrain

#### Talk Description:

traintraintrain is a proof-of-concept project that allows commuters to track their MRT train locations in real-time from anywhere. We placed Raspberry Pis underneath seats in trains and used wifi scans from the Pis to infer the location of the train. The project arose from our team’s hackathon in January 2018, and we’ll be sharing our journey and some interesting technical details from the project.
