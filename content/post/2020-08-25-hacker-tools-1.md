Welcome to Hacker Tools! This session, we'll be talking about virtual machines and their usage, and then putting it into practice by walking through the installation of Ubuntu in VirtualBox, a popular and open-source hypervisor.

Please download Ubuntu, and download and install VirtualBox beforehand, because the files may be large and will take a while to download:

- VirtualBox: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
- Ubuntu: https://download.nus.edu.sg/mirror/ubuntu-releases/focal/ubuntu-20.04.1-desktop-amd64.iso

Please also make sure you have virtualisation enabled in your system firmware. See [this page](https://archive.is/SLebO) for a guide.
