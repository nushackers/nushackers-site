Awwwwwwwwww.....Cute toddler spotted! <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/tshirts/kids/5ace/action/21059cb/">Source: ThinkGeek</a></em></div>

I just read that someone had actually named their little bundle of joy... wait for it.... "<a href="http://www.linux.com/feature/149992">Linux</a>". :o Nothing wrong with that. It just made me recall my lecturer for organic chemistry gossiping about how some of his peers had named their children after organic compounds and elements even. I wonder if anyone will be naming their kids after Linux distros. *Imagines* "Hello Ubuntu, you are so cuttteeeeeeeeeeee!"

On a related note, check out the baby man page at <a href="http://linuxshellaccount.blogspot.com/2008/09/baby-man-page-more-linux-and-unix-jokes.html">The Linux and Unix Menagerie</a>.

Not enough of Linux babies yet? Get some shirts from <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/tshirts/kids/5ace/action/21059cb/">ThinkGeek</a> and transform your nearest toodler into a Linux icon :D
