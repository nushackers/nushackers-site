### Functional Systems in a Non-functional World

#### Talk Description:

In systems engineering we deal with shared state, impurities and mutable data. Nix and NixOS provide a practical and efficient way to remove a lot of that ugliness in a safe, repeatable and reliable way.

We will be going through how it solves real-life problem such as as:
- cleanly change (and roll-back) deployed systems
- ensuring developers have the exact same environments
- getting rid of language/framework specific package managers (virtuelenv, rbenv, etc) to provide a single cohesive language

This is not an abstract functional programming talk but we will show how the principles from FP make perfect sense for defining practical systems.

#### Speaker Profile

Peter Hoeg from Speartail Pte Ltd - a Singapore MSP that deals predominately with customers in the transportation sector. In addition to running all our Linux based code on NixOS, we use it for generating appliances that we deploy with our customers.
