### Reality Hybridation: from Biology to Digits

#### Talk Description:

The reality we perceive is a product of our thoughts and senses. For many millennia we have been using paper, calculators, clocks, telescopes and many other external tools extending the capacities of our brain and sensors. Today, smartphones, and soon smartglasses, augment reality production and perception orders of magnitude beyond biology.  Bit by bit, exabyte by exabyte, we are building a new world.

#### Speaker Profile

Joaquín KELLER has a MSc in mathematics and PhD in distributed computing. He is a senior researcher at Orange Labs (France Telecom R&D) and Centre de Recherche Interdisciplinaire de Paris. He started programming AI in 1991 and has since worked in prominent research institutes and universities. He has lead research teams on projects like peer-to-peer virtual worlds, decentralized search engines and scalable multimedia live streaming. He recently started exaQuark, a company aimed at building mixed reality experiences at planet scale.



### Hello Kube

#### Talk Description:
Johannes discusses the core concepts of Kubernetes, introduces the tools and resources used to try Kubernetes out, and bringing a bare bones Kubernetes cluster running a web service online, with the help of a couple community resuources. Most code and configuration presented is available at github.com/jhanschoo

#### Speaker Profile
Johannes is a CS undergrad and part of NUS Hackers coreteam. He's still new to working with Kubernetes himself, but is pretty certain that what he's going to present is clean, solid stuff.
