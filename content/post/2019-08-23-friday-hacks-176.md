### Intro to purely functional data structures

#### Talk Description:

Data structures used in imperative languages, like arrays and hashtables, depend on "destructive" assignment to be efficient. Functional programming languages recommend a different approach to data structure design. We'll explore some basic examples of purely functional data structures and talk about how to recover efficiency.

### Kedro - Production Ready Data Pipelines

#### Talk Description:

Spending long hours hunting down data sources, cleaning and building machine learning models only makes sense if your work can be deployed and achieve value for users. QuantumBlack is an advanced analytics company specialising in ingesting, engineering and modelling with huge amounts of real-world data from clients. In this talk, we would like to discuss tips and tricks, tied to real life projects of working with large data, and building production ready code from the outset. We will also share details on Kedro, QuantumBlack’s open source pipelining tool, that we use on all our engagements to structure work, and deploy quickly.
