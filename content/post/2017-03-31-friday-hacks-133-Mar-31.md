### Perspectives on Cyber Security

#### Speaker Profile

JEFF MOSS
Jeff Moss has spent the last 17 years as founder and director of Black Hat and DefCon, two of the most influential information security conferences in the world. Moss speaks frequently before a wide range of audiences on the topic of computer and information security. In 2009 Moss was appointed to the Homeland Security Advisory Council to provide advice and recommendations to the Secretary on matters related to homeland security. Moss is uniquely qualified with his ability to bridge the gap between the underground researcher community and law enforcement, between the worlds of pure research and responsible application disclosure.

#### Speaker Profile

HALVAR FLAKE
Thomas Dullien / Halvar Flake started work in reverse engineering and digital rights management in the mid-90s, and began to apply reverse engineering to vulnerability research shortly thereafter. He pioneered early windows heap exploitation, patch diffing / bindiffing and various other reverse engineering techniques. In 2004, he started zynamics, a company focused on reverse engineering technologies. He continued to publish about reverse engineering, ROP gadget search, and knowledge management technologies in relation to reverse engineering. In 2011, zynamics was acquired by Google, and Halvar spent the next few years working on defensive technologies that leveraged the then hot buzzwords "big data" and "machine learning". In summer 2015, Halvar received the lifetime achievement Pwnie, and decided to take a year off to travel, read, and surf. Since November 2016, he is back at Google.
