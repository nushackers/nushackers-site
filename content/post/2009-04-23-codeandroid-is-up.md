The <a href="//www.codeandroid.org/">codeandroid</a> guys now have their very own IRC channel on Freenode. linuxNUS is pleased to be <a href="//opensource.nus.edu.sg/ca_irc/logs/">hosting the logs for #codeandroid.</a>

The following is a message from their FB group:

Dear developers,

We have set up our IRC channel at #CodeAndroid on irc.freenode.net where developers can discuss and help each other out in development. Please do join us in our discussion. We will also be offering support for the upcoming ITSC's CodeXtreme competition in June/July through livechat on the channel, so if you are a participant do stay tuned. Thank you.

Cheers
From CodeAndroid Team
