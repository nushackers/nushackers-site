Always wanted to install Linux on your PC/laptop but don't know how to? Want to find out how to dual-boot Linux and Windows? Or even triple boot (with MacOS)? Fancy having some cool visual effects on your desktop?

linuxNUS will be having a hands-on Ubuntu Install Workshop on 12 Sep 07 (Wed). Our technical experts will be on hand to answer your questions and assist you in the installation and configuration process on your laptop PCs. If you do not have a laptop and want to install Ubuntu on your home PC, you can use a lab PC to go through the installation process.

Date: 12 Sep 07 (Wed)
Time: 7pm - 9pm
Venue: COM 1 Basement, Programming Lab 1 (COM 1 is right beside BIZ canteen)
Fees: $2 for linuxNUS members, $5 for non-members (sign up as a member to enjoy immediate savings!).

Notes:
     1. If you have your own Ubuntu CD, please bring it along as we only have a limited number of CDs
     2. Bring a multiplug along if possible
     3. If you are using your laptop, backup important data before coming. If possible, create a partition for Linux of at least 5 GB space first.
     4. Printed materials will be provided
     5. Light refreshments will be provided

If you are interested, please register by sending us an email with the Subject: Install Workshop. Places are strictly limited and registration is on a first-come-first-served basis. Please indicate if you are bringing your laptop so that we can better allocate resources.
