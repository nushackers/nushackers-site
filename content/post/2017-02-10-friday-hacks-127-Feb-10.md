Hardware hacking always appears more difficult than it seems. Many commercial products are much cheaper when assembled yourselves, and you get an educational experience as a bonus side-effect.

#### Speaker Profile
Ding Feng is a Year 1 Computer Science undergraduate, who enjoys creatively clobbering together weird objects to make something remotely useful.


### Wi-Fi Hacks: Hacking the Air Around Us
