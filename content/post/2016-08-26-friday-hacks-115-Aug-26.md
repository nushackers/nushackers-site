### Diving Into Other People's Code

#### Talk Description:

Working with a large, unfamiliar, legacy codebase is a large part of any professional
software engineer's job, but something you hardly learn in school. While you learn to
design and write code in school, in a real job the majority of the work is in reading
code. Other people's code.

This talk will explore the tools and techniques you have digging into code which you
didn't write, don't understand, and have never seen before in your life. I will take a
large open-source codebase and demonstrate what techniques, tools and tricks you
have in order to navigate make a meaningful change to such an unfamiliar project

#### Speaker Profile

Haoyi is an engineer on the Web Infra and Developer Tools team who joined Dropbox after graduating in 2013. He likes functional programming and is the one person at Dropbox writing Scala full-time.



### Deploying Data.gov.sg

#### Talk Description:

Data.gov.sg helps the public understand and use Singapore's open government data. We pull data from agencies across the government use it and publish charts, articles, and developer APIs.

This talk will cover the development of Data.gov.sg's production infrastructure. How we went from a single server to our current deployment environment involving Docker, Git hooks, multiple AWS services and more.
