<strong>Update! Venue is now changed to Seminar Room 9, on the second floor of the Education Resource Centre, UTown
</strong>

Will be held at the Collaborative Commons at UTown. That's on the first floor of the Education Resource Center (above Starbucks), next to the PC Commons. We'll be having James Yong over to give an informal, one hour talk about PCB etching, and have gotten the word out to a  couple of members to come and listen in.

The rest of us may choose to listen in, or otherwise would be perfectly alright with working on your own stuff, with earphones. We've also set up a <a href="http://nushackers.pbworks.com/w/page/45116359/Friday%20Hacks%20Ideas%20and%20Instructions">wiki to get new beginners started</a> on Friday Hacks - be it for their homework, new projects, or other stuff.

Details:

<blockquote><strong>Location</strong>: <del datetime="2011-09-09T07:43:13+00:00">Collaborative Commons</del> <strong>edit: venue is now changed to Seminar Room 9</strong>, Education Resource Centre at University Town.
