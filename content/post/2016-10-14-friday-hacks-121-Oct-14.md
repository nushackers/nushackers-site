### GraphQL in an Age of REST

#### Talk Description:

GraphQL is an application layer query language from Facebook. With GraphQL, you can define your backend as a well-defined graph-based schema. Then client applications can query your dataset as they are needed. GraphQL’s power comes from a simple idea — instead of defining the structure of responses on the server, the flexibility is given to the client. In this talk, discover a new approach to build and expose Web APIs. Will GraphQL do to REST what REST did to SOAP?
