### 20 Ways to Get Involved with the Developer Community

#### Talk description

How can a student or anyone curious get involved with the developer community beyond school or work? And why? This talk will scan through the developer scene both locally, globally, online or on-ground and give examples on where anyone can contribute, get involved and get more information about the vibrant technology scene.

What communities can you join easily and learn? Which meetups can you attend and even help to co-organize? How to start contributing to open source? Can we easily share with by writing our own blogs, books or even making podcasts? What are some interesting twitter accounts or blogs to follow? How can we add in short trips to engage with locals while traveling anywhere in the world? We will discuss all these questions and more!
