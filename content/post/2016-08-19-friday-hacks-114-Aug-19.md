### Welcome Tea

#### Talk Description:

Friday Hacks are back for this new academic year! 

Please join us in our Welcome Tea, where our President will share about what we do, the importance of fostering hacker culture in NUS and how to hack life!

All freshmen & current students from all faculties are welcome to attend. As always, free pizza starts at 6.30pm ;)

NUS Hackers is a student-run organization committed to the spread of hacker culture & free/open-source software. We provide a support system for hackers in NUS who are currently building things (be it for charity, business or pleasure). We also hold workshops, organize weekly meet-ups, run hackathons, and maintain open source code for the NUS community.
