## Quantum Theory: A First Approach to the Modern Paradigm, and What It's Good For

In this talk, Clive & Lin will briefly run through some crucial findings that called for a new physics. Focusing on its broad mathematical formalism, alongside illustrations, they will explore what exactly characterizes quantum theory, how it explains these discoveries and the bizarre questions it brings to the fore.

In the second half of the talk, technical details about quantum theory will covered, which will give you a taste of two specific quantum protocols—an inefficient way of factoring numbers (with hints at a possible speedup), and a secure way of distributing shared private keys. Finally, a brief overview of other technologies enabled by our understanding of quantum theory will be covered, with the reminder that quantum technology is present all around us.

### Speakers' Profile

Clive Cenxin Aw and Zaw Lin Htoo are PhD students from a theoretical group at the Centre of Quantum Technologies. Clive's research interests lie in comparing the reversal of classical processes and that of quantum processes, especially in connection to what might be said about entanglement, memory and thermodynamics in the quantum regime. Lin works primarily on methods to certify that “something quantum” is really happening in simple systems, like pendulums and spinning tops, with a secondary interest in theoretical and numerical studies of quantum devices.
