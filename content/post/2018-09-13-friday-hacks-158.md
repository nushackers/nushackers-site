### Homo ex Machina: Uploading man on hard drive

#### Talk Description:

In Singapore for a few days: join [Sergei Markoff](http://markoff.science/index_en.html), a world-famous expert on artificial intelligence, for his talk on neural interfaces, neural models & possibilities of uploading consciousness on a flash drive in our time.

The borderline between AI and humans has been getting thinner. How close are the latest technologies to creating a machine that’s equal to a human brain? How do you extract information from a brain? How do you restore failing body functions using neural interfaces? Get these and more questions answered!

We’ll cover the brief history of neuromorphic machines, learn of the existing invasive and non-invasive interfaces, brainstorm around neuroplasticity and dive into the recent progress in bionic prosthetics & creating animal-cyborgs.

### Internships, and How to Get Them
