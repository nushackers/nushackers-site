## 1) Abusing Sensor Data for Fun (and Profit?)

We are surrounded by more sensors than ever before. We could use them as intended, but that would be boring.

Sriram will explore how research abuses sensors to expose risks, and uncover hidden use cases.

### Speaker Profile

Sriram is a PhD student at NUS, working on active sensing systems. He was previously the Co-Founder and software lead of Yonah, building unmanned aircraft systems to deliver medical supplies.

## 2) Building a modular IoT transaction platform

Jacek will share the experience of building a middleware that has evolved from a simple Android application to a micro-service used to interact with a variety of payment terminals.

### Speaker Profile

Jacek is the Co-Founder & CEO of Beep, with established deployments in the vending industry, powering major FMCGs, government distributions.
