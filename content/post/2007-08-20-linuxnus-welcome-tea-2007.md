Hi everyone

It's a new academic year again, and linuxNUS is organising a Welcome Tea for freshmen to find out more about who we are and what we do! This will take place on 22 Aug 2007 (Wed) at 1830hrs in COM 1 / 207.

The purpose of this session is to formally introduce you to our Coreteam members as well as get to know each other better. We will also announce the array of exciting events that we have lined up for you in the coming months. Light refreshments will be provided.

Take this opportunity to get to know members of the Linux and Open Source community here in NUS, and learn about the important role Open Source software plays in this era. Many entrepreneurs have introduced innovative products with Linux and FOSS as a platform for development. ZopIM, one of the budding startups at the E27 Garag3 will also be present at the Welcome Tea.  Learn how Open Source software has enabled them to quickly develop and deploy their application.

We will be giving out more Ubuntu installer CDs, on a first-come-first-served basis. If you need any assistance pertaining to Linux, we will be on hand to answer any questions you may have (i.e. wireless connectivity issues, etc).

If you would like to attend, please drop us an email at contact@linuxnus.org with your name and contact number. This is so that we know how many people are coming and provide for enough refreshments. Also, if you want an Ubuntu CD, let us know as well so we can reserve one for you!

We look forward to meeting everyone at the Welcome Tea.
