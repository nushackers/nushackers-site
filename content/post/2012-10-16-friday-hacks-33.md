<h3>Talk 1: Sound and Interaction in the browser using the WebAudio API</h3>

<strong>Preparation:</strong>
If you want to "code along" to make some noise of your own, bring your computer with the Chrome *Canary* Browser installed.

<strong>Talk Description:</strong>
The formative WebAudio API will make powerful real-time and interactive sound synthesis standard fare for browsers. Coupled with new networking technologies, and APIs for accessing device capabilities, this ain't your grandmothers browser any more. The talk will present some recent explorations with WebAudio, discuss some of the open issues with the developing standard, and show you how you can add interactive sound to your web pages.

<strong>Speaker Profile:</strong>
Lonce is on the faculty of the Communications and New Media Department, and directs the Arts and Creativity Lab at the Interactive and Digital Media Institute (IDM). He's been making noise with computers for about 30 years, and his current research focus is on technologies for communication between live networked performers.

<h3>Talk 2: An Introduction to LaTeX</h3>

<strong>Talk Description:</strong>
If you're a Science or CS major, the reports you'll be writing will have a fair amount of math. However, math input in Microsoft Word is not easy, and many features are missing. If you've been wondering how your professors typeset their teaching materials, and want the same type of quality for your reports, use LaTeX.

This talk will give you a broad introduction to LaTeX.

<strong>Speaker Profile:</strong>
Shawn Tan is a computer science undergraduate planning to pursue a career in research. His interests lie in machine learning and AI in general.
