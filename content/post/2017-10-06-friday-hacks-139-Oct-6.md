### Parking.sg: from Prototype to Production

#### Talk Description:

Parking.sg is an app to pay for street parking without needing coupons. Learn how the app was built from the initial prototype to roll it out island wide. We will talk about the product, engineering, and bureacratic design decisions that were made to get us successfully to launch.

Things we'll cover include:

- Pitching with prototypes instead of slides
- Stripping away unecessary features so you can focus on what is important
- Designing a data model for a distributed system
- Reliable apps while having an unreliable network
- Designing a clean user experience

#### Speaker Profile

Hongyi likes to build things. As the Deputy Director of the Product and Engineering Team at GovTech, his job is to design, evangelize, and implement software to help improve the public good. Projects he's launched include Data.gov.sg, Beeline.sg, and Parking.sg. Prior to joining the government Hongyi worked at Google. There he designed the current Image Search "page split" UI and worked on Spanner: Google's Globally Distributed Database.

### Asynchronous Processing

#### Talk Description:

Asynchronous processing is an important methodology for systems design which allows execution of expensive calculations independently of critical/responsive system flows. In this talk, we will be:

- Shedding the light on Asynchronous processing landscape (servers, frameworks, and libraries).
- Showcasing an example technology, Sidekiq, and how to use it to accomplish Async Processing.
- Outlining Sidekiqâ€™s strengths and weaknesses compared to other options in the landscape.
- Take an quick tour to the internals of Sidekiq, to reveal some interesting architectural tradeoffs.

#### Speaker Profile

Mohammad is an Engineering Manager at TradeGecko. Through his career, he worked with multiple technology stacks and enjoyed testing out and experimenting many others. He worked both in the financial sector, where engineering performance & optimization is key, and in lean product development environments where user-centric design is a priority. In his free time, he loves to experiment with technologies and food (yes, he can make some interesting middle-eastern dishes). Some of the topics that excite Mohammad: Distributed Systems Design, Operations Research, Parallel Processing, Graph Theory, Queueing Theory, Database Design & Domain Driven Design.
