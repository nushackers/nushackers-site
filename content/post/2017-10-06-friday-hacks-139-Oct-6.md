### Digital Parking App

#### Talk Description:

TBC

#### Speaker Profile

Hongyi worked as a product manager at Google from 2011 to 2013. During that time he worked on Spanner with the infrastructure team and the UI redesign of Image Search. He’s currently back in Singapore working at IDA on a new team trying to make the government more data driven.

### Asynchronous Processing

#### Talk Description:

Asynchronous processing is an important methodology for systems design which allows execution of expensive calculations independently of critical/responsive system flows. In this talk, we will be:

- Shedding the light on Asynchronous processing landscape (servers, frameworks, and libraries).
- Showcasing an example technology, Sidekiq, and how to use it to accomplish Async Processing.
- Outlining Sidekiq’s strengths and weaknesses compared to other options in the landscape.
- Take an quick tour to the internals of Sidekiq, to reveal some interesting architectural tradeoffs.

#### Speaker Profile

Mohammad is an Engineering Manager at TradeGecko. Through his career, he worked with multiple technology stacks and enjoyed testing out and experimenting many others. He worked both in the financial sector, where engineering performance & optimization is key, and in lean product development environments where user-centric design is a priority. In his free time, he loves to experiment with technologies and food (yes, he can make some interesting middle-eastern dishes). Some of the topics that excite Mohammad: Distributed Systems Design, Operations Research, Parallel Processing, Graph Theory, Queueing Theory, Database Design & Domain Driven Design.
