## 1) Cool Hacks from Hack&Roll 2023 (Pt. 2)

This week, we are inviting more teams to present their hacks! We have the team Tybbit that made a mind-bending and annoying keyboard game, the team NUSCTEA that harnessed the power of GPT-3 API to convert text to any language of choice, and the team NativeSay that created a translation app that helps users understand the context for translations. Coolest part? One of the teams is planning to launch their project for the public!

### Speaker Profile

NativeSay and Tybbit were among the top 8 of Hack&Roll 2023, while NUSCTEA won Best Beginner Hack.
