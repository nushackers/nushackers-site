## 2) Automating AKS Deployments on Azure with Terraform: From Infrastructure to Workload
Learn how to streamline Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) provisioning and workload deployment with Terraform. This session walks through defining AKS infrastructure as code, connecting to Azure Container Registry, and deploying a sample application with auto-scaling—all wrapped in a simple, repeatable workflow.
Through a hands-on demo, you’ll learn how to:
 1 Use Terraform to provision AKS and supporting Azure resources.
 2 Automate container image access via Azure Container Registry (ACR).
 3 Deploy and scale workloads with Kubernetes manifests and Horizontal Pod Autoscaler.
 4 Integrate everything into a simple CI/CD workflow for repeatable delivery.
