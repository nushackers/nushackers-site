### Implementing and Breaking RSA in the Real World

#### Talk Description

Textbook RSA is typically taught as a basic application of number theory or as a common asymmetric encryption algorithm. In this talk, we will go through how it is typically used in the real world, as well as how we can break incorrect implementations of RSA.

#### Speaker Profile

Herbert is a year 5 Computer Science + Mathematics undergraduate, as well as a NUS Hackers coreteam member.

### A Look Under the Hood of Stripe.js

#### Talk Description

Stripe.js are pre-built UI elements that abstract away the complexity of integrating with complex payment methods, easing integration experience for developers. In this talk, I will share about the workings of Stripe.js, and explain the design considerations that were made in creating this library.

#### Speaker Profile

Ankita works as a Software Engineer at Stripe, working on building global payments infrastructure. She enjoys working on both front-end and back-end technologies as a part of her work. Her interests involve web development, distributed systems, data pipelines, and infrastructure management.
