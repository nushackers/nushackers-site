## 1) AI with Human-in-the-Loop

With the emergence and success of deep learning, CS research has entered a new era of data-driven research paradigm, seeming replacing the paradigms of experimental, theoretical and computational based research. However, while the deep learning data-driven paradigm has brought vast improvements in performance, it also introduces uncertainties in solution because of its black box nature and its lack in trust and robustness. 

The first part of this talk examines the history of CS, and in particular AI, and discusses the new research paradigm that combines data driven and knowledge oriented AI towards a trustable and robust AI.

The second part of the talk discusses the roles of humans in the AI eco-system, especially in solving the last-mile AI problems. The talk covers recent research in incorporating AI and HITL (Human-in-the-Loop) into proactive information search and recommendation, multimodal conversation, and Fintech applications. The talk highlights the challenges of incorporating multimodal data and context in conversation, HITL, and the extensible and pro-active framework to enable the system and users to co-evolve and becoming more intelligent together.

### Speaker Profile

Prof Tat-Seng Chua is the KITHCT Chair Professor at the School of Computing, National University of Singapore (NUS). He is also the Distinguished Visiting Professor of Tsinghua University, the Visiting Pao Yue-Kong Chair Professor of Zhejiang University, and the Distinguished Visiting Professor of Sichuan University. Dr. Chua was the Founding Dean of the School of Computing from 1998-2000. His main research interests include unstructured data analytics, multimodal conversational search and recommendation, and robust and trustable AI. He is the co-Director of NExT, a joint research Center between NUS and Tsinghua University, and Sea-NExT, a joint Lab between Sea Group and NExT.


## 2) Engineering for Latency, Technical Hurdles in Automated Trading 

Latency is at the core of everything Huston River Trading (HRT) does. In this session, engineers from HRT will discuss the importance of latency, and share some technologies and techniques used to minimize latency in the critical path.
