## 1) AI with Human-in-the-Loop

With the emergence and success of deep learning, CS research has entered a new era of data-driven research paradigm, seeming replacing the paradigms of experimental, theoretical and computational based research. However, while the deep learning data-driven paradigm has brought vast improvements in performance, it also introduces uncertainties in solution because of its black box nature and its lack in trust and robustness. 

The first part of this talk examines the history of CS, and in particular AI, and discusses the new research paradigm that combines data driven and knowledge oriented AI towards a trustable and robust AI.

The second part of the talk discusses the roles of humans in the AI eco-system, especially in solving the last-mile AI problems. The talk covers recent research in incorporating AI and HITL (Human-in-the-Loop) into proactive information search and recommendation, multimodal conversation, and Fintech applications. The talk highlights the challenges of incorporating multimodal data and context in conversation, HITL, and the extensible and pro-active framework to enable the system and users to co-evolve and becoming more intelligent together.
