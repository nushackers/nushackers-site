### Robust, scalable, and secure mobile apps in hostile environments.

#### Talk Description:

The Wobe system architecture is designed to work in environments with highly unreliable network access. In fact, it assumes a poor network and accounts it from day one.

The Wobe architecture is asynchronous and event/message based vs. the more common synchronous architectures. It's comprised of a mobile client for Android and a collection of microservices developed in Go. It's designed to work in high latency, low bandwidth environments and poor reliability network access.

In addition, Jordan will be sharing Wobe’s plans for open sourcing significant components of its architecture to help others adopt a better mobile services architecture. If you are looking for an interesting, approachable, challenging open source to contribute to, this is your chance to learn more.
