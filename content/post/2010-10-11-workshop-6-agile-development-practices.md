From the Agile Manifesto :<br/>
<em>
We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:<br/>
<strong>Individuals</strong> and interactions over processes and tools<br/>
<strong>Working</strong> <strong>software</strong> over comprehensive documentation<br/>
<strong>Customer</strong> <strong>collaboration</strong> over contract negotiation<br/>
<strong>Responding</strong> <strong>to</strong> <strong>change</strong> over following a plan</em><br/><br/>

<em> </em><em>That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.</em><br/><br/>

This workshop will definitely help you in working in teams and in building software applications in the most productive manner possible.<br/><br/>

<strong>Venue</strong> : COM1/202, School of Computing NUS<br/>
<strong>Time</strong> : 6.30-8.30pm<br/>
<strong>Date</strong> : 15th October, Friday<br/>
<strong>Places</strong> only limited for the first 70 registrants<br/><br/>
