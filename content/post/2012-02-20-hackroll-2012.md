Hack&Roll 2012 is now entering its final stretch with 4 hours left before the end of the event.

Walking around the basement, there is a sense of excitement in the air as the participants gear up to finish hacking their app/product for the judges later. 	<em>(As I'm typing now, there is a team going to the SRC now to do the final tweaks and testing for their UAV. Yes, an unmanned air vehicle. Awesome shit.)</em> Can't wait for their presentations later.
