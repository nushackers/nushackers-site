### C++ Template Metaprogramming

#### Talk Description:

For some, the term "Template Metaprogramming" conjures up thoughts of complex and headache-inducing code. But it doesn't have to be. This talk will provide a breadth-focused introduction of several commonly-used ideas in Template Metaprogramming through the following use cases:

1. Compile-time evaluation/calculations
2. Automatic selection of type of object to instantiate
3. Overloading functions based of type groups/traits instead of individual types

This talk is aimed at users with experience in C++.
