<h3>Talk: Product Analytics: Building Something People Want</h3>
<div>

<strong>Talk Description:</strong>

<strong></strong>Say you've built a digital product, and usage is bad. How do you know what to build next? How do you know how well your product is doing? The answer is to use analytics. But many metrics (number of downloads per day) are useless, and the useful ones are non-obvious. This talk details the minimum set of metrics every digital product needs to keep track of, with some implementation details, and lays out some of the principles I've found useful to come up with *other* metrics specific to your product. Equally important to keeping track of product analytics is the need to create culture - at the organisational level - to use these metrics. I'll talk about how two companies I've worked at have succeeded or failed at using metrics in their product development, and outline a process I've seen work well for a small product development team. Come if you're interested in building stuff people want to use.
