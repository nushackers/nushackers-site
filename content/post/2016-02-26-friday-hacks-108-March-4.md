# File Store Engine in Go --- how to reduce GC overhead

### Description
In Garena, we store hundreds of TB of files and serve more than ten thousand file download requests per second. This huge workload requires an efficient file store engine. We chose BeansDB in the beginning, but find it not appropriate when used in the high speed cache system. Finally, we decide to rewrite it in Go language. Although Go is much simpler and more a pleasure to write compared with C, it also introduces a new problem, the GC issue. In this talk, we will go deep in this topic and share the best practices we learnt in reducing GC overhead. Meanwhile, we also show that the Go GC system is still continuous evolving thanks to the effort of Go dev team.

### Speaker's Profile
