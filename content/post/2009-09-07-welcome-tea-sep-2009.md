Hi everyone,

I hope everyone has had an enjoyable summer break! To the freshmen, I bid you  a warm welcome to the NUS family on behalf of linuxNUS!

To usher in the beginning of the new academic year, we are organizing a Welcome Tea. The linuxNUS Welcome Tea will be held at <a href="http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/aboutsoc/location.shtml">COM 1/SR10</a> on <strong>09/09/09 (Wed) at 7pm</strong>. The purpose of this session is to introduce to you linuxNUS's activities and related Open Source goings-on in NUS. We will also announce the upcoming exciting events that we have lined up for you. Light refreshments will be provided too.

The agenda of the Welcome Tea is listed below:
- Introduction about linuxNUS and Open Source@NUS
- Google Summer Of Code sharing session by successful participants

This is a great opportunity to get to know folks of the Linux and Open Source community in NUS, and learn about the importance of Open Source software in this era.

We will be giving out Ubuntu 9.04 and Fedora 11 installer CDs (while stocks last, so hurry down :p) If you need any assistance pertaining to Linux, we will be on hand to answer any questions you may have (i.e. wireless connectivity issues, etc).

If you would like to attend, please register at <a href="http://linuxnus.org/register/welcometea2009/">http://linuxnus.org/register/welcometea2009/</a> This is so that we know how many people are coming and provide for enough refreshments. Also, if you want an installer CD, let us know as well so we can reserve one for you!

We would also like to take this opportunity to introduce our vibrant <a href="http://linuxnus.org/chat">webchat on the FreeNode IRC server</a>. For any enquiries, please email us at contact@linuxnus.org.

We are looking forward to meet all of you at the Welcome Tea. Be there~!

Cheers,
Daniel Dao Quang Minh
President
linuxNUS
