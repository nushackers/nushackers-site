Welcome back folks! We will be exploring cool hardware at our next Friday Hacks! Ever wondered what goes into building a laser cutter machine? Machine builder Kiwi will be doing a reverse teardown of a CO2 laser cutter! A team from Ionic3DP will also be sharing about their experiences in building their own 3D printers! You can look forward to live demos (:

Date/Time: Friday, March 3rd at 6:30pm
Venue: The Hangar by NUS Enterprise
Free pizza is served before the talks!

### An Introduction to DIY Laser Cutters

#### Talk Description:

Laser cutting is a technology that uses a laser to cut materials, and is typically used for industrial manufacturing applications, but is also starting to be used by schools, small businesses, and hobbyists. Laser cutting works by directing the output of a high-power laser through optics and CNC (computer numerical control).

Common uses are cutting and engraving patterns onto materials such as wood, leather and acrylic, and is considered one of the faster processes in rapid prototyping. Join us for this sharing session to demystify the laser cutter machine!

#### Speaker Profile

Kee Wee Teng is an innovative machine designer and builder, and has worked on a multitude of fabrication machines, including CNCs, 3D Printers, vacuum formers and laser cutters. Dismayed by the slow decline of manufacturing capabilities in Singapore, he set out to set an example by building a machine in 6 months with limited resources and knowledge, able to do additive, subtractive, forming and cutting manufacturing, and showcased it at Makerfaire 2016. He hopes to inspire and encourage others in Singapore to adopt the same innovative Maker spirit that built early Singapore! Kee Wee was also recently featured in Challenge Magazine: https://www.challenge.gov.sg/print/feature/taking-things-into-their-own-hands

### The Kappa 3D Printer

#### Talk Description:

Ionic3DP will be presenting their new 3D printer design which is based on Scott Russell Kinematics. Briefly talking about the existing products in the market and their limitations. An overview of the technology used in our design, itâ€™s features and advantages. Finishing with how we began the project and our goal towards the future. 

#### Speaker Profile

Francis Regan graduated from School of Computing NUS and has been working in the 3D printer industry for more than 7 years. Xinxin Du finished his PhD from ECE NUS recently and he is heavily involved in the projects related to automation and control. Shabbir received his MBA from Cardiff Business School, United Kingdom. His experience is more towards business and was with Techgrand to provide mentor supports to startups.
