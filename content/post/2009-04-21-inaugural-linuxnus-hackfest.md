The HackFest started off at <a href="http://www.geekterminal.com/">Geek Terminal</a>. The turnout was hardly shabby :) We had post-its stuck to our laptop, indicating who we were and our development interests. However, the venue proved a little unconducive for any serious coding, no thanks to the changing volume of music as well the cacophony from some teenagers.

Thanks to the Neng Giin and Microsoft, we were able to shift our coding party to Microsoft office at 1 Marina Boulevard Lvl 22 at around 3pm. The room we were given was definitely more suitable than Geek Terminal for a HackFest.

Junk food and Coke were plenty. And we were also treated to Pizza, courtesy of Microsoft. At the end of the HackFest, the gang switched from being coders to Guitar Heroes!

Besides having fun, the session was also a great place to share knowledge. Some of the things shared were <a href="http://www.parrot.org/">Parrot</a> and <a href="http://www.recessframework.org/">Recess PHP Framework</a>. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ruiwen/sets/72157617001011319/">More photos by Ruiwen on Flickr</a>.

Many thanks to Neng Giin for helping us organise this event and Microsoft for being such a wonderful host.
