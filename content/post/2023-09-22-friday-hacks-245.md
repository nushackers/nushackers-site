## Online Algorithms Made Easy 

The world around us is constantly changing and at Jane Street we're receiving new data at a rate faster than ever before. When running complicated models that contain many parameters, reacting to a change in a single parameter by restarting the entire model is impractical. Instead, Jane Street makes use of ideas from research into self-adjusting computation in order to turn static models into models that can be partially recomputed in an efficient way. This talk will introduce the idea of self-adjusting computation and show how it can be used to make online algorithms easy to run and update efficiently.

### Speaker Profile

Lester Tan is a software engineer at Jane Street. He graduated with a degree in Computer Science from NUS in 2019, and is currently working in the Singapore office.
