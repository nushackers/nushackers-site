# NUS SoC Print

Find out what goes on behind the scenes of the NUS SoC print apps. Additionally, Kheng Meng will also be looking for developers to take over these projects.

# Introduction to Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)

BLE is a new and emerging wireless communication standard that was only ratified in 2010. Designed primarily to save power, it is not backward-compatible with the conventional Bluetooth we are all familiar with. Find out how to harness this technology for your hardware projects with live demos and coding examples involving the Arduino, Raspberry Pi, Android and iOS.

Kheng Meng is a recent Computer Science graduate from NUS SoC. He developed both the Android and iOS versions of the NUS SoC Print apps that are still in use today. He used to work at a hardware startup Innova Technology which makes Bluetooth anti-loss devices. After graduating, he is now a hardware developer at Algo Access, a med-tech startup providing solutions for optometrists.
