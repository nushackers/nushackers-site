Just in case you've missed it (details of the Welcome Tea were included in the last two NUS Hackers posts) we have a Welcome Tea this very Friday (2nd of September). The details are as follows:

<blockquote>Date: 2nd September 2011
Time: 6.30pm to 8.30-ish pm.
Venue: COM1 SR3 [COM1/212].
Agenda: We want to keep this to about an hour. Alumni will be speaking, the current president will explain some administrative stuff, and then weâ€™ll all break for talking, free pizza and drinks.</blockquote>

Sign up here (not necessary, but good for us organizers to order pizza):
