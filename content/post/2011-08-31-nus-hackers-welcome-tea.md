Just in case you've missed it (details of the Welcome Tea were included in the last two NUS Hackers posts) we have a Welcome Tea this very Friday (2nd of September). The details are as follows:

<blockquote>Date: 2nd September 2011
Time: 6.30pm to 8.30-ish pm.
Venue: COM1 SR3 [COM1/212].
Agenda: We want to keep this to about an hour. Alumni will be speaking, the current president will explain some administrative stuff, and then we’ll all break for talking, free pizza and drinks.</blockquote>

Sign up here (not necessary, but good for us organizers to order pizza):
