## 2) How to Build an Exchange

Electronic exchanges play an important role in the world financial system, acting as focal points where actors from across the world meet to trade with each other. However, building an exchange is a difficult technical challenge, requiring high transaction rates, low, deterministic response times, fairness, and reliability. This talk looks at the question of how to design an exchange through the lens of JX, a crossing engine we built at [Jane Street](https://www.janestreet.com/) for clients to access our proprietary liquidity.

### Speaker Profile

Shi-Jie Khor is currently a software engineer at [Jane Street](https://www.janestreet.com/) Singapore, focusing on developing tools to study trading strategies in the firm. He graduated as valedictorian with a double degree in Mathematics and Computer Science from NUS in 2017. Outside of work, you will often find Shi-Jie in board games cafes, on climbing walls, or trying to solve puzzles at puzzle hunts.
