## 2) How to Build an Exchange

Electronic exchanges play an important role in the world financial system, acting as focal points where actors from across the world meet to trade with each other. However, building an exchange is a difficult technical challenge, requiring high transaction rates, low, deterministic response times, fairness, and reliability. This talk looks at the question of how to design an exchange through the lens of JX, a crossing engine we built at [Jane Street](https://www.janestreet.com/) for clients to access our proprietary liquidity.
