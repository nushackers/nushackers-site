## FH 240: Code Golf

For the last Friday Hacks of this semester, we are extremely excited to finally hold Code Golf again after 3 years!

Code Golfs are programming challenges with a twist: shortest solutions win! So, forget your programming languages' best practices. See how well you know your favourite languages and pit your skills against other attendees!

We’ll be making use of GitHub to run the challenge, so be sure to create a GitHub account at https://github.com before you arrive and remember to bring your laptop!

You’ll be allowed to use your favourite programming language. Further challenge details will be revealed on the day itself!

As usual, we will be serving food and drinks. See you at Code Golf!

#### Speaker Profile

Cold Gold will be conducted by Wei Heng. He is an NUS alumnus who idled away his undergrad days on esoteric endeavors like code golf.
