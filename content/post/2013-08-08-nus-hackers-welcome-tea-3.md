<em>(In the jargon of the computer programmer, a hacker is someone who strives to solve problems in elegant and ingenious ways.)</em>

NUS Hackers is a student-run organization committed to the spread of hacker culture &amp; free/open-source software. We provide a support system for hackers in NUS who are currently building things (be it for charity, business or pleasure). We also hold workshops, run hackfests, and maintain open source code for the NUS community!

Please join us in our Welcome Tea, to be held on Friday, 16th of August. Details are as follows:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Date</strong>: 16 August 2013
<strong>Time</strong>: 6.30pm to 8.30pm.
<strong>Venue</strong>: <a href="/res/2011/12/fridayhacksmap.gif" target="_blank">SR2, Education Resource Centre, Utown
</a><strong>Agenda</strong>: Pizza and drinks will start at 6:30pm! Thereafter, NUS Hackers alumni will be sharing their experiences in the industry, our president will talk about administrative matters and membership.</p>
This semester, we have weekly gatherings called <a href="/fridayhacks/" target="_blank">Friday Hacks</a>, a place where you can hack or learn how to hack. There will be seniors around to guide you along and answer your technical questions. We also have <a href="http://school.nushackers.org/" target="_blank">Hackerschool</a>, a small series of workshops designed to teach various technical skills that are currently in use in the industry.

If you're interested in becoming a better programmer or hardware hacker, or if you're a person who already spends too much time programming for fun, we're the right place for you!
