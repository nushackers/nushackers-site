Vim is a popular text editor, used by many for the efficient creating and editing of text. Come join us at this workshop to learn how to use it effectively, from the basics. Beginners welcome!

Please ensure you have Vim installed. Vim in WSL 2, Linux, or macOS is preferred; a native Windows install may be quirky.

See you there!
