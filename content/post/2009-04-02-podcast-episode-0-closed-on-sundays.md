Aaaandd.. here we go!

Presenting to you, fresh (somewhat) from the oven, <a href="http://opensource.nus.edu.sg/podcasts/linuxnus-episode00-closed_on_sundays.mp3">Episode 0 of the linuxNUS Podcast, <em>Closed on Sundays</em> </a> !

Inside, catch up with the linuxNUS Team as we come together to create our very first-ever podcast. In it, we take a light-hearted look at the open source scene in Singapore, and our journey through it. Naturally, we welcome everyone out there along for the ride, and, <em>of course</em> , we'd love to hear what you have to say about us, and what we're doing.

This being Episode 0, we have to say it's still somewhat raw, but hey, it's a good effort!  Oh, and it's about a week late too, so don't be too worried about us referencing things in the show that have already passed. We ran into some.. um.. <em>production issues</em> . Yeah. That's it. Enjoy. Also, don't forget to check out the shownotes embedded within the MP3 itself.

We hope you enjoy the podcast! Oh, and did we mention feedback is always welcome?
