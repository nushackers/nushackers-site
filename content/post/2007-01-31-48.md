<strong>Introduction to XAMPP</strong>

Ever heard of <a title="XAMPP" href="http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html"> XAMPP</a> by <a title="Apache Friends" href="http://www.apachefriends.org/">Apache Friends</a>? Itâ€™s a pre-packaged [Linux/Windows]AMP stack to install in your own computer!! It is not for use in production environments, but for developers to have a web server immediately. That way, they can get on with the thing they want to do: develop software. And we can wait for the fruits of their efforts.
