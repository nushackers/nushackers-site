<p>Welcome back! Please note that we're shifting Friday Hacks to <b>University Town's ERC, SR2 </b>this semester. Also, we will start at <b>6:30pm, with pizza served first! :)</b></div><br>
<div></p>
<p>This week we have Benjamin Tan, a software engineer and SoC Alumni talking about his experiences building and releasing a Ruby gem, and Cedric Chin, an NUS student, speaking on software testing as a way of avoiding bugs.</p>
<div>
<div>
<div><b>Date/Time:</b> Friday, January 16 at 6:30pm</div>
<div><b>Venue:</b> SR2, Education Resource Centre, University Town. Map: <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/2Zy3M" target="_blank">http://goo.gl/maps/2Zy3M</a></div>
</div>
<div><b>Free pizza is served before the talks.</b></div><br>
</div>
<div></div>
<p><b>Talk 1: Coderippa, or how I built my first Ruby gem (Benjamin Tan, NUS Alumni)</b></p>
<div></div>
<div><b>Talk Description:</b></div>
<p>Coderippa (<a href="http://code-rippa.heroku.com/" target="_blank">http://code-rippa.heroku.com/</a><wbr />) is a gem that turns any file or code directory into a beautiful, readable PDF ebook. Why did I built it? Well, we don't take the time to study the code written by the masters. I have absolutely no idea how vim works, neither do I know all the magic that goes behind Rails, or how Coffeescript is written in Coffeescript and Rubinus is written in Ruby ... You get the idea.</p>
<p>CodeRippa is my attempt to make source code reading a more pleasurable experience, and help programmers get better at their craft. This talk covers the things I've learnt from building it.</p>
<div></div>
<div><b>Speaker Profile: </b></div>
<p>Benjamin Tan graduated from SoC last year, and is now living the life as a Software Engineer.</p>
<p><b>Talk 2: </b><b>Testing: Never Fear Bugs Again (Cedric Chin, NUS Student)</b></p>
<div><b>Talk Description: </b></div>
<p>Ever had the experience where you push some changes to your app, and cause a set of bugs to appear in some <i>other</i> part of your program? Well, testing is supposed to prevent this sort of behaviour. In this talk I'll make the case for testing your software (and when <i>not</i> to) and walk you through some basic ideas using Rails and RSpec as an example. Talk directed at programmers who don't (yet) test.</p>
<div><b>Speaker Profile:</b></div>
<p>Cedric was formerly President of NUS Hackers, and considers himself a web developer. He likes green tea, Python, and cats.</p>
