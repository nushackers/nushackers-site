### TDD Changed My Life

#### Talk Description:

Test Driven Development (TDD) is an engineering technique where tests and code are written in small increments, with tests written before code.  When done well, it has surprisingly large impacts on the quality of the code. This presentation will explain how it works, and then demonstrate it in action.
