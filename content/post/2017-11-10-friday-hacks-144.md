### Contributing to Open Source Projects

#### Talk Description:

Ever wanted to contribute a software you use everyday but found the codebase too daunting? Or perhaps you never thought you too can contribute to a host of exciting projects which thousands of people use everyday?

This Friday, we will share why you should contribute to open-source projects, and how to get started! As speakers, we have NUS students who have contributed to different projects in the past.

We also have our very own Professor Damith who will be talking about the open source scene in NUS and how you too can get involved!
