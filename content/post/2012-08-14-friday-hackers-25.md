title: NUS Hackers Welcome Tea

(In the jargon of the computer programmer, a hacker is someone who strives to solve problems in elegant and ingenious ways.)

NUS Hackers is a student-run organization committed to the spread of hacker culture &amp; free/open-source software. We provide a support system for hackers in NUS who are currently building things (be it for charity, business or pleasure). We also hold workshops, run hackfests, and maintain open source code for the NUS community!

Please join us in our Welcome Tea, to be held on Friday (the 17th of August), details as follows:
<blockquote><strong>Date</strong>: 17 August 2012
<strong>Time</strong>: 6.00pm to 8.30pm.
<strong>Venue</strong>: COM1 SR3 [COM1/212]
<strong>Agenda</strong>: NUS Hackers alumni will be sharing their experiences in the industry, the current president will explain administrative and membership stuff, and then weâ€™ll all break for free pizza and drinks.</blockquote>
This semester, we have weekly tech talks called 'Friday Hacks', as well a small series of workshops, designed to teach various technical skills that are currently in use in the industry.

If you're interested in becoming a better programmer or hardware hacker, or if you're a person who already spends too much time programming for fun, we're probably the right place for you.
