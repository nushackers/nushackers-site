# Phishing attacks and countermeasures
Phishing attacks are an important variety of Internet security threat which has been affecting the progress of E-business and E-commerce quite adversely. Safety requirement of e-commerce transactions, quite naturally therefore, has prompted the development of a number of measures meant for countering such attacks. However, these countermeasures have remained rather ineffective in reducing the attacks, and also the resulting huge losses suffered by victims of such attacks.
