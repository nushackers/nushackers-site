## 1) Taming open code LLMs for SQL generation and bug fixing

This talk will include a hands-on session that will guide participants through the exciting world of fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) using state-of-the-art techniques such as PEFT and QLoRA.

During this session, participants will discover how to harness the power of CodeLlama to address two critical use cases: Text-to-SQL generation, and bug fixing and vulnerability remediation.

_Participants will need to create a HuggingFace account for the hands-on session._
