### Tales of an InfoStealer

#### Talk Description:

Cybercrime is a billion dollar industry with high returns and low risks. This presentation will cover some of the current techniques being used by cyber criminals to steal intellectual data of organisations and shed some details on attribution of the cyber criminals.

#### Speaker Profile

Vicky is a Consulting Engineer for Malware and APT solutions in Palo Alto Networks. His past experience has been in Incident Response and Threat Intelligence and has been involved in building National CERT teams. His recent interest has been on performing attribution on APT attacks which is one of the most difficult aspects when investigating cybercrime.

### Inappropriate Applications of NFC

#### Talk Description:

Near-Field Communication (NFC) is a technology that enables short-range wireless communication. It is widely introduced as a communication medium and has been implemented as a method for contactless payment and physical access control. This talk will focus on exploring the standards behind the implementations of NFC, the different mediums of RFID data storage and how RFID tag designs are updated due to changing security environments.

#### Speaker Profile

A hardware geek by nature, Jeremias is a Computer Engineering student from NUS. He loves dissecting electronics with a screwdriver (and hammer) and solving problems with simple engineered solutions. His interests lie in the development of embedded systems using microcontrollers such as atmegas and MSP430, and designing of web applications using NodeJS and circuit boards such as Altium, Eagle. In the future, he seeks to develop a low cost Software Defined Radio which allows broadband and noise resistant wireless interactions.
