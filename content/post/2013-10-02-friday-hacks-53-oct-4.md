<h3>Talk: Picking a Startup to Intern At (Cedric Chin - NUS Student)</h3>
<strong>Talk Description:</strong>
The most commonly repeated advice about tech internships is that you should do two: one at a large company, and one at a startup. Picking a large company to work for is fairly easy: Google, Facebook, Palantir are reputable places to work, and are fairly well known. On the other hand, picking a good startup to work for is difficult. What you want to do is to pick a good company while they're small - 5 - 20 people small. The problem is that when companies are small, it's not clear if they are good. My talk will focus on how to do this, with some success.

<strong>Speaker Profile:</strong>
Cedric Chin is an Computer Science major at NUS. He ran the NUS Hackers from late 2010 - mid 2012. He's interned at enough startups to know that they're all trainwrecks on the inside - even the good ones. Previous internships: Kicksend, Viki.
