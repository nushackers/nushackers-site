We're just about two weeks away from the 2009 edition of <a href="http://www.e27.sg/">e27</a> 's <a href="http://www.e27.sg/unconference/2009/">unConference</a> . This year, on 16th May, entrepreneurs, VCs, and followers of the local technology development scene will converge on Matrix@Biopolis for a Saturday's worth of healthy discussion and mutual recognition. As usual, unConference once again will feature talks and breakout sessions, focused on the world of tech and entrepreneurship. This time round, however,Â  the expect a slightly more international twist, with keynotes and showcases by speakers and startups from around the region, and indeed, the world.

By attending the unConference, you'll get a chance to rub shoulders with many a startup founder, many an entrepreneur, and probably even possible future collaborators for your own startup. Remember, networking (<em>not</em> the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rj45">RJ45</a> kind) may very well open doors for you in the future! Get inspired by <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/rafer">Scott Rafer</a> , CEO of <a href="http://www.mybloglog.com/">MyBlogLog</a> (<a href="http://mashable.com/2007/01/08/yahoo-mybloglog/">now part of Yahoo!</a> ), who will be a keynote speaker at the unConference. Learn from the community by taking part in the <a href="http://eventplanning.about.com/od/eventindustrytermsae/g/defbreakout.htm">breakout sessions</a> , courtesy of the generous people willing to share their knowledge (as it stands, <a href="http://www.e27.sg/unconference/2009/breakouts/">breakout topics</a> include: <a href="http://djangoproject.com">Django</a> , <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flex/">Adobe Flex</a> , Online Social Networks, Robotics, and developer performance tips). Discover what the hottest startups in Singapore and the region are working on, with the startup pitching session, where they'll showcase their products.

Importantly, the unConference caters to the community. Therefore, our dear readers, if there's a topic you would really, <em>really, </em> like to hear about, let us know in the comments, and we'll pass them right along to the guys at <a href="http://e27.sg">e27</a> to see what they can do about it.
