Today, we would like to introduce a brand new online event that we are running for the first time, OpenHack &mdash; a new event focused on open-source contributions. OpenHack encourages students to **start contributing to open-source projects or create new (and fun!) open-source projects**.

Never contributed to an open source project before? This is your chance to make a start! 😃

OpenHack will span from now to 15<sup>th</sup> July, and there are **prizes to be won upon completion of the challenges**! 🏆

Do visit our [event website](https://openhack.nushackers.org/) to find out more about the challenges! You can join others that are trying to complete the challenge at [our OpenHack Telegram chat](https://t.me/nushackers_openhack) as well to discuss ideas or to get help! Or just lurk and absorb the ideas, we don't mind too!

Have fun contributing!
