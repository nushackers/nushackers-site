<h3>Talk 1: Crawling and sentiment analysis: practical hacks with Python (Sourabh Rao, NUS Student)</h3>
<strong>Talk Description:</strong>
I'll be talking on sentiment analysis, the theoretical nitty gritty of it and how it can be used in practical projects. I'll also be introducing a project I am working on to build a pandora like music player which uses the concept of sentiment analysis to build music libraries.

<strong>Prep:</strong>
I'll be starting from scratch. I assume a basic understanding of programming.

<strong>Speaker Profile:</strong>
I am a freshman at NUS. I was a SRP researcher at NUS during Junior College and worked on genetic algorithms. I founded a profitable question answering portal called sqare. I was also fortunate to have spent a quarter at MIT during which I was exposed to ideas of sentiment analysis. Currently, I am an engineering intern at semantics3.
<h3>Talk 2: Making Sense: Introduction to working with ontologies (Michael Li, Research Officer, Data Analytics Dept, NBAC)</h3>
<strong>Talk Description:</strong>
Ontologies are a different way to store data and knowledge as compared to the conventional model of using databases. This talk and hands-on session will be an introduction to using ontologies and demonstration of why we use it (and like it!)

<strong>Speaker profile:</strong>
Michael Li is a research engineer in Institute for Infocomm Research whose work is in semantic technology and focused towards the healthcare industry.

He graduated from University of Melbourne with a Biomedical Engineering Degree specializing in Bioinformatics.
