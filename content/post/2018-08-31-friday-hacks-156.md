### Intro to concurrent functional programming with Async

#### Talk Description:

Programming with concurrency can be difficult. This talk is going to give an introduction
to Async, a library for concurrent programming in OCaml, developed and heavily relied upon
by Jane Street.  I'll give a brief intro to concurrent programming, talk about how it can
be hard and how Async approaches these issues.  The talk will also cover basic usage of
Async and a glimpse at some advanced features.
