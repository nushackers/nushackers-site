### Open Source Aircraft Autopilots in Practice

#### Talk Description:

The autonomous drone scene has grown staggeringly quickly over the past few years. Part of this is due to the availability of commercial grade and cheap open-source autopilot hardware (the Pixhawk series of flight controllers for example) together with open-source autopilot software (Ardupilot).

This talk will be in a few parts:

- The worldwide autonomous drone ecosystem and community
- Case studies, including: how we are using this ecosystem in Yonah to serve the remote and rural in Papua New Guinea.
- How you can get started with (autonomous) drones
- How you can contribute to this open-source community

#### Speaker Profile

Sriram Sami is a third year computer science undergraduate student and part of the core team of Yonah. Yonah is a social enterprise that is dedicated to empowering people in some of the most remote and inaccessible parts of the world through their expertise in the designing and utilisation of UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles). He will be joined by Sim Zhi Min, a mechanical engineering graduate student and co-founder of Yonah.

### Auto Valuation of Residential Homes in Singapore

#### Talk Description:

There's been a rise of real estate startups in the west where they use their own balance sheet to provide instant liquidity to home sellers by buying directly from them. At the heart of this phenomenon is an accurate machine learning valuation model of homes. With this business case in mind, we started looking to build our own valuation model for Singapore homes based on some 20 years of transaction data.
