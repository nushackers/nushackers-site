<div>
<div>Ever wondered how you could go about building an app like NUSMods?</div>
</div>
<strong style="line-height: 1.5em;"></strong>
<div>I’ll be sharing the challenges faced and lessons learnt from building and rebuilding NUSMods - from the early stages of iterating on its MVP based on user feedback and metrics, to the upcoming 2.0 version.</div>
<strong style="line-height: 1.5em;"></strong>
<div>I’ll also give a preview of some interesting new techniques used in NUSMods 2.0, which will have multiple points to integrate and promote contributions from the student community. To end off, we'll discuss the future of student-made apps, and how you could contribute too.</div>
