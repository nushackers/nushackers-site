After an awesome holiday that saw brilliant hacks by many of our members, including <a href="http://modivle.yrmichael.com/welcome" title="modivle" target="_blank">MODIVLE</a>, <a href="http://nusmods.com/" title="nusmods" target="_blank">NUSMods</a>, and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nus.ais.mobile.android.shuttlebus&hl=en" title="nus next bus" target="_blank">NUS Next Bus</a>, we are now looking to restart our activities in the coming academic year.

Just a couple of quick announcements. We will be kicking off with a welcome tea on Aug 17, and following up with our long awaited first Friday Hacks of AY2012/2013 the week after. We are currently looking out for potential speakers on technical topics, and of course pizza sponsors, so if you are interested in doing something with us, feel free to drop us an email over <a href="/contact/" target="_blank">here</a>.

Alright, and cya all next semester :D
