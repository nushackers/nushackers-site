It seems that the ever increasing popularity of Firefox web browser has caught the attention of Center for Instructional Technology (<a href="http://cit.nus.edu.sg/">CIT</a>). As such, CIT has designed the next rollout of Integrated Virtual Learning Environment (<a href="http://cit.nus.edu.sg/IVLE/">IVLE</a>) Version 8 to support Firefox, in addition to Microsoft Internet Explorer (MSIE).

CIT has collaborated with linuxNUS to recruit testers for functional testing of IVLE 8 in non MSIE browsers.

<blockquote>Testing will be carried out in 2 "phases":

1. Bug Day #1: Everyone come together to do testing, ask questions etc

While (Time Permits)

2. Self - service testing day: Testers go back and test on their own remotely.

Each will be allocated a different section to test. After testing, users clock in their time spent and bugs found

3. Break: Testers take a break while developers do the necessary code changes to fix the bugs

Loop
</blockquote>


The "Bug Day" will take place at Computer Centre PC Cluster, Computer Centre Building Level 3 on 24th May 2007, 10am to 5pm. The pay Rate: $7 per hour. Remote testing is at $6 per hour.

linuxNUS is proud to be part of this effort to support Firefox compatibility in IVLE 8.
