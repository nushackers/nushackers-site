## 1) Exciting Trends in Music Technology with Deep Learning

In this talk, we'll journey into the fascinating the world of music technology. We will discuss how tech has impacted various aspects of music ranging from creation (music generation, audio synthesis), consumption (recommendation, hit song prediction) and distribution (copyright detection, soundtrack analysis). Furthermore, with the recent advances in deep learning / generative AI, we will also discuss some exciting trends emerging at the forefront of music technology, as well as the safeguards needed to ensure that AI continues to be assist and inspire, instead of replacing music artists.
