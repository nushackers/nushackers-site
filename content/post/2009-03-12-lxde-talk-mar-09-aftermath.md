Thank you to Mario for the wonderful presentation. And here are some pretty photos of us!

We had dinner at Dover after the talk. The food was great and so was the company.

Quite a few ideas popped out from the conversations. One suggestion from Mario was to organise some girl only events to attract girls into Open Source. This has been successfully practiced in Taiwan. Another idea that is likely to be worked on is to organise FOSS.SG.
