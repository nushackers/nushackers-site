<blockquote><em>Last week, AMD released register specifications for the RV630 and M56 parts into open source, thus allowing the OSS community to develop 2D (and theoretically 3D) drivers, given time. Current documentation for the project is available over at X.Org.</em></blockquote>

Hit the <a href="//arstechnica.com/journals/linux.ars/2007/09/21/amdati-release-register-specifications-novell-follows-with-alpha-driver">article</a> for further details.

The specifications for ATI graphics hardware are finally open sourced and Novell has been quick to release an alpha-quality driver for the R6XX and R5XX series of cards.

Let's hope this will be end of the frustration that many Linux users with ATI cards have been facing.
