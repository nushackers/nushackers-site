This week, we'll be covering another popular command-line editor, Emacs. We'll be covering the installation and configuration of Doom Emacs, a popular Emacs configuration framework that provides a sane base for you to get on your ((Emacs) '(journey)). Come peek at what Emacs has to offer!

Please setup Doom Emacs using the following VirtualBox image or native install instructions before the workshop.
