### Building Autonomous Underwater Vehicles

#### Talk Description:

More of outer space has been explored than the vast oceans on our own planet. Here's where underwater vehicles come in – they help us research and learn more about the seas! They can also be deployed to repair pipeline or localize missing planes. BumbleBee Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (BBAUV) is a student team that builds such vehicles but with a twist, the vehicle is fully autonomous.

Alex will be sharing about the tasks done underwater and how they're achieved. Topics covered include control systems, computer vision with openCV, acoustic localization and autonomous mission control.

BBAUV competes twice a year, in San Diego USA and in Singapore. Find out more about the competitions they take part in at Robosub.org and SAUVC.org!

#### Speaker Profile

Alex is the software lead of BBAUV15 and has worked on mission planner, drivers for navigational sensors and spatial navigation. He's a second year computer engineering undergraduate at NUS.
