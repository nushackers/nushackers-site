### Spiking Neural Networks

#### Talk Description:

Over the past few years, Neural Networks have demonstrated superior performance in tasks such as image classification and motion tracking. However, these networks are not well suited for mobile and embedded systems due to power and computational constraints which allows for only simple models to be used. Spiking Neural Networks have been shown to be much more energy efficient compared to more traditional NN architectures, allowing us to perform more inferences with more complex models on edge devices.

#### Speaker Profile

Kyle is a year 3 Computer Engineering Undergraduate and is currently working on an UROPs project on accelerators for spiking neural networks.
