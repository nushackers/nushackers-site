Recently, I delivered
[a presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qMi_zQxm6E9fxXi8RFnfhaOvvCHEGzD-NPQjpD_F63w/edit?usp=sharing) on
techniques that enable real-time collaboration, with a focus on text
editors. Since, I've developed an interest in how text editors are
implemented. This series is an attempt at an overview of the internals
of all popular text editor implementations (including, but not
exhaustively: MS Word, Vim, Emacs and Atom).

The implementations I present are far from an exhaustive list of all
possible text editor implementations. Simpler implementations can be
easily conjured (eg. simply represent the text as an array of
characters). However, these naive implementations are inefficient, and
never found in product-ready text editors, and are hence not discussed.

# Abstracting the text editor

Before any discussion about text editors is made, we need to define a
few terms. An *item* is the data type in question. In most
implementations, the *item* refers to an ASCII character. A text editor
 maintains a *sequence* (ordered set) of items. The *position* of an
item is the index of the sequence which identifies the item (usually
0-indexed).

All operations on a text editor can be derived from the following
primitive operations:

1.  `Empty()`: Create a new empty sequence
2.  `Insert(seq, pos, i)`: Insert new item `i` at position `pos` in
    sequence `seq`.
3.  `Delete(seq, pos)`: Delete the item at position `pos` in sequence
    `seq`.
4.  `ItemAt(seq, pos)`: Returns the item at position `pos` in sequence
    `seq`.

Compound operations such as pasting (multiple inserts) can be obtained
with a combination of these operations.

## Buffers, Spans and Descriptors

A *buffer* is a set of sequentially addressed memory locations. Think of
it as a slice of memory (although not technically correct, it
happens to be true with regards to text editors). This sequence of memory
locations do not have to correspond to that of the sequence. For
example, the sequence "abc" need not be represented as "abc" in the
buffer. In the scenario where both the buffer and the sequence are
logically contiguous, we call it a *span*. *Descriptors* are simply
pointers to these spans.

Because many text implementations require buffers to be able to grow
infinitely large, buffers tend to be stored in disk files, rather than
in memory.

# Piece Table

We start our journey by looking at piece tables, found in early
versions of Microsoft Word, and Abiword, the document editor I swore
by several years ago. Both Abiword and MS Word use an in-RAM piece table.


## Implementation

The piece table uses two buffers. The first buffer is called the file
buffer, and contains the original contents of the file, and is read
only; the second buffer is called the add buffer, and is a
dynamically-sized buffer that is append-only.

The sequence starts off as one big span, and is subsequently divided
into smaller spans after several editor operations.

The piece table is implemented as a doubly-linked list, often with
sentinel nodes at the head and tail. The choice of a doubly-linked
list is because of its simplicity, and is not the only data structure
compatible with piece tables.

While pieces contain no text; they contain information about the text
object it represents. Specifically, piece objects store the start,
end and buffer ID, and all together they identify a span in the
sequence.

    struct piece
    {
      piece   * next;
      piece   * prev;

      size_t   start;
      size_t   length;
      size_t   buffer;
    };

It follows from this design that pieces don't know their logical
position in the sequence. They only know the physical location of the
data they represent, and this makes insertion and deletion quick. It
does, however, suffer from the same limitations of a doubly-linked
list: There is no way to directly access a specific text-offset
within the document. This issue is circumvented if a tree structure
were to be used instead of a linked list. All this will be clear in
the next section, where the piece table is put to the test.

## Initializing a piece table

We start off by opening our file, containing the text "piece outz".

This creates a read-only file buffer containing the ten characters,
and an empty add buffer of arbitrary size.

`Empty()` is called, creating a doubly-linked list with just the sentinel
head and tail nodes. A span is then created, which represents the
entirety of the file buffer contents. This span is appended to the
linked list.

## Removing text

Suppose we want to change the text from "piece outz" to "pizza outz".
First, we'd have to remove 3 characters "ece".

Here, the original big span is split into two. The two spans
represent, respectively:

1.  The items before the delete (in this case "PI")
2.  The items after the delete (in this case " OUTZ")

In general, the delete operation increases the number of spans in the
piece table by 1.

## Insert text

Now, we have to insert the characters "zza" in the correct position.
Note that if several items are inserted in a row, the items are
combined into a single span. These characters are first appended to
the add buffer. Next, the span is split into 3:

1.  The first span represents the items of the old span before the
    insert. ("PI")
2.  The second span represents the inserted items ("ZZA")
3.  The third span represents the items of the old span after the
    insert ("")

## Advantages

Notice that the original file is read-only; this is friendly for
caching. Also, everything is append-only, lending itself to cheap
undos by smartly storing previous descriptors.

In addition, text editors like MS Word require the storage of
formatting information. This is trivial, since appended text in the
add-buffer never changes its memory address, and can be safely refered
to with pointers.

The size of the piece table is a function of the number of insert and
delete operations, and not the size of the file, which makes this
ideal for editing large files.

## Disadvantages

The idea behind the piece table I described in this article is simple.
Implementation, however, can get unwieldy, and is certainly lengthier
than other data structures. The versatility of piece tables lend
themselves to the availability of a whole host of optimizations, which
tend to end up as a huge ball of mud.

Modern text editors seldom implement piece tables underneath. Piece
tables were invented some 30 years ago, in an era of limited memory
and slow CPUs. Computers then were unable to handle less efficient
sequence data structures, such as arrays of lines as spans. These
archaic data structures power Vim and Emacs, and no one's complaining
about the editors being slow. This, however, is an article for another
day.

In the next article of this series I'll be covering Emacs and some of
the common misconceptions surrounding it.
