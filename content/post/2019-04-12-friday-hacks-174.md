### Hacking on the Linux kernel

#### Talk Description:

Ever wondered what goes into the development of the Linux kernel? We discuss, among other things, the kernel's development process and some rationale behind it, how to get a patch into the kernel, some useful tools in figuring your way around the kernel source, and some ideas on how to actually work on the kernel codebase itself. As far as possible, no background knowledge about operating systems will be assumed.
