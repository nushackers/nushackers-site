### Aspect Sentiment Analysis for Company Benefits

#### Talk Description:

Job seekers are very interested in the benefits a company provides.  We can summarize how often benefits are mentioned in reviews about the companies, but the raw counts can be misleading - the review can be complaining about the lack of or poor quality of a benefit.  This problem calls for aspect sentiment analysis - annotating the sentiment of a particular topic or aspect in a text as opposed to the sentiment of the text as a whole.  We discuss the problem in detail, the initial out-sourced solution, and how we replaced this with a solution built in-house during a hackathon.

#### Speaker Profile

Alex Shinn is a Senior Software Engineer at Indeed
