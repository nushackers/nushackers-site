## 1) OpenEvolve: Towards Open Evolutionary Agents
OpenEvolve is an open-source evolutionary coding agent that democratizes algorithmic discovery by combining LLMs with evolutionary computation. Our research demonstrates remarkable achievements: replicating AlphaEvolve's mathematical optimization results, discovering GPU kernel optimizations with 12.5% performance improvements for transformer attention, and achieving 2.04x speedups on algorithm benchmarks. Surprisingly, open models like Gemma 3 27B and Qwen3-Coder rival proprietary alternatives, proving that cutting-edge evolutionary AI capabilities can be accessible to everyone. This talk presents our journey towards truly open evolutionary agents for automated algorithm discovery.

## 2) Sequencers, Speed and the Strategic Life of an Order
This talk will take you inside the core of a high-performance trading system, following an order‚Äôs journey from the moment a strategy decides to trade to the instant that order reaches the market, and the execution report returns. We‚Äôll unpack the sequencer architecture that enforces determinism, the risk and routing layers that run in the fast path, and the mechanisms that ensure scalability, reliability, and recoverability under extreme load. Attendees will get a clear, step-by-step view of how a production-grade system achieves predictable microsecond-level latency without sacrificing correctness.

### Speaker Profile üéôÔ∏è
Dr. Bogdan Tudor is a Senior Software Engineer and Managing Director at Virtu Financial Singapore. Bogdan has worn many hats since joining Virtu in 2014 ‚Äì from core developer overseeing Asia-Pacific connectivity, low-latency team lead, to head of development for Asia-Pacific, and now Managing Director & CEO of Virtu‚Äôs entire proprietary business in the region. He holds a PhD in Computer Science from NUS, where his research focused on performance prediction of shared-memory programs, and a Computer Engineering degree from UPB Romania.
