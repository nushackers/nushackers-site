Hey Hey! We know we are late with putting up the materials for the 2nd workshop that was on Mercurial Version control system. The penguins were really busy with studies.


The slides for the presentation are available at:

Due to time constraints, we left out some details, particularly on the collaborative part, the one which we talked about so much at the beginning, but not to worry - here are some sites to aid you in your journey with VCS:
