It’s the last Friday Hacks of the semester, and to end it off with a blast (before we rush to catch up with all our webcasts during the reading week), instead of having talks, we will be having a Code Golf Challenge!

### Code Golf

#### Talk Description:

Code Golfs are programming challenges with a twist&mdash;shortest solutions win! So, forget your programming languages' best practices. See how well you know your favourite languages and pit your skills against other attendees!

We’ll be making use of GitHub to run the challenge, so be sure to create a GitHub account at https://github.com before you arrive!

You’ll be allowed to use your favourite programming language. Further challenge details will be revealed on the day itself!

See you at Code Golf!

#### Speaker Profile

The challenge will be hosted again by Kuan Wei Heng, a veteran code golfer who has been golfing for years!

Please RSVP at our Facebook event [here](https://www.facebook.com/events/407578953464893/) if you are coming so we know how many people to cater for.

See you there!
