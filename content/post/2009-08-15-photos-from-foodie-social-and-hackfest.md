Hi guys, I have finally uploaded the photos of the <a href="http://linuxnus.org/2009/07/23/the-linuxnus-foodie-social/">Foodie Social</a> and <a href="http://linuxnus.org/2009/08/06/linuxnus-hackfest-the-third-hack-reality/">Hackfest</a> from my Android phone. They are not fantastic due to my poor photography skills but they are definitely the tip of the iceberg of the fun we had!
