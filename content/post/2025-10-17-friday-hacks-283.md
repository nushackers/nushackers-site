## 2) Homebrew at Scale: Automated Builds and ARM64 Linux

In this talk, we will explore Homebrew, the package manager for macOS and Linux, from a maintainer’s perspective. We will examine how Homebrew’s fully automated CI pipeline builds and distributes binary packages (bottles). Then, we will discuss the technical challenges of porting Homebrew to ARM64 Linux, from architecture compatibility issues to future roadmap plans.

### Speaker Profile 🎙️️

​Ruoyu is a Master of Computing student at NUS School of Computing and an active contributor in the open-source software community. He is a maintainer of Homebrew since 2023, focusing on brew the package manager and the official homebrew/core package repository. He also serves on Homebrew’s Technical Steering Committee.
