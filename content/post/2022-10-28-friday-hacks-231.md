## 1) Prototyping a (tile grouting) robot at home on a budget

Hardware doesn't have to involve huge capital investments. A decent Ender 3 costs just over $200, a soldering station costs $40, a bench drill costs over $100, and online shopping is your good friend. This workshop will show how we build our robot from ground up, explaining how our various mechanical components come together. Fabrication techniques that we would cover include 3D printing (PLA and PVA Filament), 3D printing troubleshooting, angle grinding, soldering, rework, using inserts, covering various mechanical components (such as stepper motor and threaded rod).
