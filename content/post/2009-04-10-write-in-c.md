A brilliant song about.. well.. writing in C.

Enjoy!

PS.
Does anyone have the lyrics to this?

<em>Update:</em>

Thanks to tan_ce and Nixxy's comments below, here are the lyrics!
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>When I find my code in tons of trouble,
Friends and colleagues come to me,
Speaking words of wisdom:
“Write in C.”</em>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>As the deadline fast approaches,
And the bugs are all that I can see,
Somewhere, someone whispers:
“Write in C.”</em>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Write in C, write in C,
Wtite in C, yeah, write in C.
LISP is dead and buried,
Write in C.</em>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>I used to write a lot of FORTRAN,
For science it worked flawlessly.
Try using it for graphics!
Write in C.</em>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>If you’ve just spent nearly 30 hours
Debugging some assembly,
Soon you will be glad to
Write in C.</em>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Write in C, write in C,
Write in C, yeah, write in C.
BASIC is for wimps.
Write in C.</em>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Write in C, write in C,
Write in C, oh, write in C.
Pascal won’t quite cut it.
Write in C.</em>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Write in C, write in C,
Write in C, yeah, write in C.
Don’t even mention COBOL.
Write in C.</em>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>And when the screen is fuzzy,
And the editor is bugging me.
I’m sick of ones and zeroes.
Write in C.</em>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>A thousand people people swear that T.P.
Seven is the one for me.
I hate the word PROCEDURE,
Write in C.</em>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Write in C, write in C,
Write in C, yeah, write in C.
PL1 is 80’s,
Write in C.</em>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Write in C, write in C,
Write in C, yeah, write in C.
The government loves ADA,
Write in C.</em>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Write in C, write in C,
Write in C, yeah, write in C.
Java’s not quite there yet.
Write in C.</em>
