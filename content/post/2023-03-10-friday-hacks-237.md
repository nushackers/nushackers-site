## 1) Coreboot, Intel, and Custom Laptops

Ever wondered how a custom laptop is built? Wanted to DIY your own hardware, and get rid of clunky firmware? Enter Coreboot.

Coreboot is an open-source firmware replacement which end-users can install on their computers. It allows users to fix exploits and improve hardware compatibility.

### Speaker Profile
[Xue Yao](https://www.xyte.ch) is a final year NUS EE student. He builds custom laptops when he is not swamped with school work.

## 2) The Hard Things about Hardware

In this talk, Ajinkya will talk about challenges with building hardware startups, and case studies of how people hacked the hardware iteration loop.

### Speaker Profile

Ajinkya is a roboticist by training and has worked on a wide array of projects, from a moon rover to exoskeletons.

In 2022, he co-founded Seamless XR, a NUS GRIP- funded startup that focuses on making interactions with virtual environments physically immersive.
