What's on March 27th, you say? Team Ubuntu Singapore, or TUSG, is going to hold a workshop / demo session in COM1, showing how it's possible to use open source software to get your work done, and live your life the way you want it! For more details, <a href = "//ubuntu.sg">check out their site</a>.

However, there's been really great response from you guys, thanks in no small part to the efforts of <a href = "//compclub.nus.edu.sg">Computing Club</a>! As our venue (Programming Lab 2) is limited in space, we've had to close registration for the event.

For those of you who've missed out, though, fret not - this huge response will no doubt encourage future events to take place, and some might take place really soon, too! If you like, you can leave us your name at <a href = "mailto:contact@linuxnus.org">our official contact address</a>. Or join our <a href = "//tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/linuxnus">mailing list</a> to receive updates!

What we'd really like is for more people to <a href = "//opensource.nus.edu.sg/wiki/index.php/Connecting_to_IRC">come by our IRC channel and hang out</a>. It isn't all that hard, now is it?
