## 1) Fuzzing Database Engines with SQLancer

SQLancer is a popular tool that can automatically find logic bugs in database systems. It generates databases and queries, whose results are then automatically checked for discrepancies, which indicate bugs in the database system under test. SQLancer has found hundreds of bugs in widely-used database engines such as MySQL and SQLite. This talk will introduce SQLancer, covering both its testing techniques as well as its code base.

### Speaker Profile
Asst. Professor Manuel Rigger is an Assistant Professor leading the TEST Lab at NUS. He works on software reliability, data-centric systems, and programming language implementation.

## 2) Creating Sustainable, Sticker-Sized Wireless Computers

Over the past several years, Prof Varshney developed low-power wireless transmitters and receivers to solve the issue of battery-replacement. They can transmit wirelessly at orders of magnitude lower power (tens of microwatts) than current transmitters and enable IoT devices with novel form factors, some of which don't even need batteries! This talk is about Prof Varshney‚Äôs journey and project STICORS, which builds and designs sticker-form-factor and sustainable wireless computers with these transistors.

### Speaker Profile
Asst. Professor Ambuj Varshney is an Assistant Professor at School of Computing of National University of Singapore. His research in low-power wireless transmitters has led to awards, accolades, and research grants, and his doctoral dissertation was awarded the 2019 ABB Research Award in Honour of Hubertus von Gruenberg.
