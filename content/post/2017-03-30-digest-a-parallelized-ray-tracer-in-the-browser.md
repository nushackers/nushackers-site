This semester, I got a chance to write a ray tracer for my parallel
programming class. I took this class because I thought it'd be fun to
learn about parallel programming constructs and practices, but I
didn't think that I'd end up writing a ray tracer for a class
assignment. Although I've never done any computer graphics programming
before, I thought this assignment was neat since it gave me an idea of
how computers can generate images and I ended up with a very visual
result of my work. So, I wrote this post to consolidate what I learnt
on ray tracing and doing it in the browser using the GPU, with help
from GPU.js.

Since I've never had any direct experience with programming computer
graphics before, I started this assignment by trying to understand
what ray tracing is and how it works. In doing so, I found two
particularly useful articles. The first,
[Ray Tracing: Graphics for the Masses](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~rademach/xroads-RT/RTarticle.html),
is a very readable and useful introduction to ray tracing's basic
concepts and terminology. The second, a
[narrative-style tutorial that implements a ray tracer in JavaScript](http://www.macwright.org/literate-raytracer/),
focuses more on implementing an actual ray tracer in JavaScript.  It
was especially helpful in demonstrating how to generate rays from a
camera.

## How ray tracing works

Ray tracing is a method for generating realistic looking images based
on tracing the path of light rays through a "world", i.e. the scene in
which we would like to generate these images. It mimics the way in
which light enters a camera or an eye to form images and simulates
that process to construct images. Imagine you're shooting a
movie. You'd have a camera, lights, and things in your set. When
recording your movie, your camera records whatever light rays that
enter its viewpoint. In ray tracing, you have the opposite effect for
the light rays. Instead of calculating the rays based on light sources
in the scene, we generate the rays out of the camera so that we only
compute the colours of the rays that we know will be *inside* the
picture. This way, we don't waste resources computing rays that will
never be part of the image.

_An illustration from Wikipedia on how raytracing works_

Ray tracing, especially when compared to other techniques for
generating images, allows for realistic rendering of images since we
can naturally mimic properties of light—such as absorption,
reflection, and refraction—when it hits a surface. As a result, ray
tracing is computationally costly and hence typically suited to
situations where we can pre-render the images ahead of time. But,
since each ray trace, and correspondingly its pixel colour on the
screen can be determined independently, determining the colours for
each pixel and hence generating the image can be done in parallel and
hence makes this problem particularly suited for the GPU. This is
where GPU.js comes in.

## Parallelizing ray traces using GPU.js

[GPU.js](http://gpu.rocks/) is an in-browser transpiler that
transpiles a subset of JavaScript into
[OpenGL Shading Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL_Shading_Language)
(GLSL). [Shading languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shading_language)
are graphics programming languages for characterizing surfaces,
volume, and colour. In GPU.js, the GLSL produced uses
[WebGL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL)—a JavaScript API for
rendering interactive 3D computer graphics that's supported in most
modern browsers—to access the GPU. Hence, GPU.js allows the programmer
to write in JavaScript and perform parallel computations on the GPU
and fall back to JavaScript when the GPU is unavailable. This is very
neat since the programmer now doesn't need to know GLSL to use it and
can write once and use it on both CPU and GPU.

GPU.js has been rather apt for this task. You create a kernel in
graphical mode and pass in a function that computes the colour for
each pixel on a canvas that the kernel returns. This can be as simple
as calling `this.color (r, g, b)` to set the pixel colours, using RGB
values, that corresponds to the `x` and `y` coordinates that each
thread is assigned to.

```javascript

let gpu = new GPU ()
let kernel = gpu.createKernel (function () {
  /* This pixel's coordinates on the canvas */
  let x = this.thread.x
  let y = this.thread.y

  /* RGB values */
  this.color (0, 0, 1)
}, {
  /* Options */
  dimensions: [800, 600],
  graphical: false,
  mode: 'gpu'
});

let canvas = kernel.getCanvas ()
document.body.appendChild (canvas)
```
_A simple GPU.js kernel that creates a 800 x 600 blue canvas using
the GPU and inserts it into a web page's body._

However, there are some caveats. GPU.js is still in its early stages
of development and so only supports a limited subset of JavaScript. It
does not support passing in or returning arrays in kernel functions
and does not support recursion (since GLSL does not support
recursion). Hence, it took a bit more coding than usual to get the ray
tracer up and running, especially since the `trace ()` function does a
number of vector operations and is typically used recursively. I
worked around this by making `trace ()` iterative and writing
functions such `unitVectorX (Vx, Vy, Vz)` to compute the *x* value for
a vector *V*'s unit vector, and similar functions `unitVectorY (Vx,
Vy, Vz)` and `unitVectorZ (Vx, Vy, Vz)` to return its *y* and *z*
values. It was a tiny bit annoying, but necessary.

## Results

It took a number of nights working on this and getting used to GPU.js'
quirks, but I'm very pleased with the end product. It was especially
gratifying to be able to see the visible differences when implementing
specific light tracing properties such as
[Lambertian reflectance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambertian_reflectance)
and
[specular reflection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specular_reflection)—giving
a surface a "matte" appearance and a mirror-like reflection
respectively. I also like that the ray tracer runs in a browser, which
allowed me to make an interactive ray tracer online. I thought Jingwen
did a really great job in making his
[ray tracer](http://raytracer.crypt.sg/) more interactive (you can
move the camera and dynamically add more spheres in it). Additionally,
when toggling between CPU and GPU mode, the differences in rendering
speed is notable, so GPU.js was definitely helpful in making tracing
fast. I don't think it would have been as cool if the ray tracer
wasn't fast enough to see the animations run smoothly. This has been
an unexpected and unexpectedly fun assignment.
