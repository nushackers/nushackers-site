<h3>Talk 1: Introduction to Game Object Component Architecture (Wong Yi, Game Programmer, SUTD Game Lab)</h3>

<strong>Talk Description:</strong>
Traditionally, objects in games were often developed using a hierarchical, object oriented approach where behaviour and data are inherited from base classes. The component based approach instead treats game objects as a generic container with individual behaviour as separate modules that are aggregated to collectively derive the desired behaviour. This session takes a look at the use of the component based approach in the development of Dark Dot, a flock based top down shooter game for the iPad.

<strong>Speaker Profile:</strong>
Wong Yi had a long time passion with gaming and entered the game industry as a programmer for Mikoishi after graduating with a degree from NTU. There, he was in the team which developed Dropcast, his first commercial game and also Singapore's first Nintendo DS game.
