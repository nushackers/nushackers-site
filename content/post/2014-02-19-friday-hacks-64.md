<h3>Talk: DNS Spoofing - The Basics and How to Prevent it</h3>
<div>

<strong>Talk Description:</strong>
<div>How can you take down a country's Internet and prevent more than 6 million users from surfing web pages for 8 hours without even standing up? Try DNS cache poisoning. In late January 2014, a case of DNS spoofing in China caused all web queries to be routed to a single IP address in the US, suspending two-thirds of all Chinese internet traffic for several hours. The Domain Name System (DNS) is the fundamental addressing system that runs the Internet.  This talk gives a brief overview of how it works, and briefly addresses DNS cache poisoning, also known as DNS spoofing, how such issues occur and can be mitigated. Learning a bit about DNS cache poisoning could go a long way towards preventing major issues.</div>
