### Web Developers' Nightmare

#### Talk description

One of the main reason why there are lots of web vulnerabilities nowadays are because many developers are not trained or are not exposed to web security.  This talk aims to provide a collection of common security mistakes that are found in web applications.

Topics covered ranges from design mistakes to implementation mistakes. Common security vulnerabilites like Cross-Site Scripting and SQL Injection will also be discussed. This talk would help attendees gain a better understanding of these issues and hopefully help them develop more secured applications. At the end, we will also discuss about security issues surrounding NoSQL databases.
