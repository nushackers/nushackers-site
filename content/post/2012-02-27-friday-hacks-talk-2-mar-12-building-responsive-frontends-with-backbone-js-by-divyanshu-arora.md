It's very easy and tempting, when working on javascript web apps, to come up with a 10000 lines worth of spaghetti jQuery callbacks and DOM manipulations that seem to just scrape by &amp; work. That is, until you make that one small, tiny little change that couldn't possibly affect anything, and BOOM!-everything breaks.</span></span></div>
<div></div>
<p><div>Restore your sanity by giving your webapp a backbone to rest on with backbone.js (ohhh the puns, if you see them), a small 600-loc library that provides a basic model/view/router foundation to build upon. I'll be giving a quick walk-through of most of these features.</div>
<div></div>
<p><div>Take a look at some amazing real world use cases like <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/static?key=mobile">LinkedIn mobile</a>, <a href="http://www.documentcloud.org/public/search/">DocumentCloud</a>, <a href="http://www.getflow.com/">Flow</a> and more at http://backbonejs.org/#examples.</div>
