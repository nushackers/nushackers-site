#### Talk description

This week, the topic for discussion is Functional Programming with Scala. Functional programming is a recent buzz word in the industry. Functional programming involves constructing programs using only pure functions with no side effects such as reading from files or mutating memory.

This idea of functional programming, leads to a very different way of writing programs than you may be used to. We therefore start from the very beginning, relearning how to write the simplest of programs in a functional way.

We will cover what is functional programming, its benefits and how pure functions can be built to achieve almost all of the regular tasks involved in programming. We will also look at basic Scala syntax and functional programming constructs. We will talk briefly about modelling state-ful programs using pure functions in Scala.
