### Introduction to Modern Programming Languages

#### Talk Description:

What's your favourite language? Java? C++? Python? Did you know that these languages have existed for at least 20 years by now? Have you heard of Rust, Scala, Swift, TypeScript, and others? In this talk, we will walk through reasons why you might want to start developing in a more modern language. We will discuss features available in those languages that make programming much easier.

#### Speaker Profile

Herbert is a year 4 computer science student and a NUS Hackers coreteam member.
