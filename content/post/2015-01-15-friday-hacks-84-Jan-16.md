#### Talk description from the speaker
Lately, I've been consumed with learning and writing about Elixir, functional
programming language built on top of the Erlang VM.

In this talk, I will give a quick walkthrough of the language. Then, in short
examples, I will demonstrate concepts such as concurrency, fault tolerance and
distribution â€“ areas where Elixir shines.

It will be a fun ride!
