### Welcome Tea

#### Talk Description:

Friday Hacks are back for this new academic year!

Please join us for our Welcome Tea, where our President will share about what we do, the importance of fostering hacker culture in NUS and how to hack life! We will also cover a brief overview of the events we have lined up for the upcoming semester and how you could get involved in helping us spread the joy of hacking!

All freshmen & current students from all faculties are welcome to attend. As always, free pizza will be served starting at <b>7:00pm</b> ;)

Read on to get a quick idea of what we do:
NUS Hackers is a student-run organization committed to the spread of hacker culture and free/open-source software. We provide a support system for hackers in NUS who are currently building things (be it for charity, business or pleasure). We also hold workshops, organize weekly meet-ups, run hackathons, and maintain open source code for the NUS community.
