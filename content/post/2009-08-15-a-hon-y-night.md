Besides the usual hacking and configuration, it only apt to unwind and take a break from geekdom once in a while. So it's time to play!

linuxNUS will be having its inaugural Games Night on the 20th Aug, this coming Thur. Our game of interest is <a href="http://beta.heroesofnewerth.com/">Heroes of Newerth (HoN)</a>, which runs natively on Windows, Linux and Mac OS. This game is very much like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_of_the_Ancients">Defense of the Ancients</a> (DOTA).

Due to a NDA, we can't publish any screenshot or videos of the game, but you can find them on the <a href=" http://www.facebook.com/heroesofnewerth?ref=ts">Facebook fan page</a>.

Who knows, if enough people, especially Linux users, play the game, then maybe linuxNUS can organise a HoN competition :)

Currently, the game is in closed BETA. But linuxNUS is giving away 10 beta keys for those who turn up during Game night  and 20 for those who post in the comments of this blog post. Alternatively, one can google around and try to fish a beta key from somewhere ;)

If there is overwhelming response in the comments of our blog post, we can consider requesting more keys from the HoN creators.

So if you are keen, here are the details:

Date: 20th Aug 2009, Thursday
Time: 730pm to 10pm (latest)
Venue: SOC1/ TR6
Map: <a href="http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/aboutsoc/location-cluster.shtml">http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/aboutsoc/location-cluster.shtml</a> and <a href="http://gothere.sg/search#linuxnus:">http://gothere.sg/search#linuxnus:</a>

<strong>Update:</strong> <em>dwu will be bringing her Wii Console, and I will be bring some games too. We will have 4 Wii motes and can definitely have some good mulitplayer action.

Problem is we will need a Wii-VGA connector. Does anyone have that?

And don't forget to bring your LAN cables for better HoN gameplay :)</em>
