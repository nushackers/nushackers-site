We're holding a <strong>Tri-University Coding competition</strong> this Saturday (12th Feb) at the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=nus+extension+singapore&amp;aq=&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=38.144864,54.140625&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=nus+extension&amp;hnear=Singapore&amp;ll=1.298732,103.844662&amp;spn=0.005889,0.006609&amp;z=17&amp;iwloc=A">NUS Extension</a>. It'll be an afternoon of programming in Ruby with our peers from NTU and SMU - but with the guarantee that you don't have to know Ruby to take part (yes, it's <em>that</em> easy).

Here's the <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/a/linuxnus.org/viewform?hl=en&amp;formkey=dFl0N0hKSDBUTnFIbFZxNTNKajJ3VlE6MQ&amp;ndplr=1#gid=0">sign up link</a>.

A brief overview of the event:
<blockquote><strong>10:30am</strong> Registration and Introduction by NUSHackers &amp; NTUOSS
<strong>11:00am</strong> <em>On Ruby</em> - by Jason Ong from the Singapore Ruby Brigade
<strong>11:30am</strong> Introduction to the Competition Platform (Singpath) by Chris and Sandra Boesch
<strong>12:00pm Competition Commences</strong>
<strong>2:00pm-3:00pm</strong> Winner Emerges!</blockquote>
<strong>Prizes:</strong> a 1TB hard disc drive, a 19' LCD screen, and 5 other consolation prizes.

<a href="http://www.singpath.com">SingPath</a> will be the Competition Platform. It's developed by SMU Professor Chris Boesch. You can test drive it before the competition!

We're rather excited to be working with the people at NTUOSS and SMU on this competition, and we hope to have everyone bring something back from it. See you there!

<em>Psst: a suggestion from one of our members: think of this as an excuse to learn a programming language - in a single afternoon!</em>
