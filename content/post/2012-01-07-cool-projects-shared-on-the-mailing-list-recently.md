We've got two cool projects recently posted to the NUS Hackers <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/nushackers">mailing list</a> to show you today.

The first is an instant CORS search at <a href="http://nuscors.com/">nuscors.com</a>, built by Rollen Gomes a week after the launch of our <a href="http://api.nushackers.org/">Unofficial CORS API</a>. Simply type a module name or code to have the list filtered down to the module you're looking for. It's blazingly fast in a desktop browser, and I must say that it's really changed the way I do my module planning.

The second cool project is a shuttlecock launcher built by James Yong (and a few other contributors) on the side, for two years, while at SoC. No technical details released, but see below for a demonstration:
