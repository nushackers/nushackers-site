This page is a hack; by default Hugo will use the section template, and generate a ~250K page with *every single post* in the website included at /post/. I can't figure out how to get Hugo to not generate the section page for just a single section (we need it for the other sections since we hacked the section functionality to make our sidebars on pages instead).
