<strong>About Quora</strong>
Quora is a continually improving collection of questions and answers created, edited and organized by everyone who uses it. The company's mission is to share and grow the world's knowledge, and was founded in 2009. Adam D'Angelo, the former CTO of Facebook, is founder and CEO.
<h3>Talk 2: Software Engineering 6501 (Winston Teo, New Context)</h3>
<strong>Talk Description:</strong>
Do you want to be a Software engineer? Software Engineering is not only about programming languages, algorithms, networks and databases. It's about creating value, getting things done, and constant communication. I'll be talking about why someone should become a software engineer and what I think it takes to be a good software engineer. Nothing technical, but you'll not learn this from lectures and tutorials.

<strong>Speaker Profile:</strong>
Winston is an Alumni of NUS School of Computing, class of 2006. He started his career in IBM as a database administrator but soon realized that he loves web development a little bit more. He made the switch to become a Web Ninja at Wego.com in 2008 and has not looked back since. Currently a software engineer with New Context, he has helped build applications such as Friendster.com and Viki.com. To him, software engineering is more Art than Science, and he derives immense pleasure from building products that people need.
