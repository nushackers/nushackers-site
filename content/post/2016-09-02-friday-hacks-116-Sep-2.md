### Project Intern

#### Talk Description:

*New venue! We're going to be trying out holding events at The Hangar by NUS Enterprise for this week.*

Learn why you should do internships, how to choose, and of course, how to get them!

Ask questions of other students who have interned locally and overseas at various companies including: Google, Palantir, Microsoft, Stripe, Twitter, Uber, Apple, Viki, GrabTaxi, Facebook, and more!

To the freshmen, it's never too early to start!

You've probably read about tech internships and all their various perks. Heck, you've probaby even seen a movie about it. Now's the time to live it. This talk will address all the questions you've ever had about internships and help you on your way to getting one.

Free pizza is served before the talks.
