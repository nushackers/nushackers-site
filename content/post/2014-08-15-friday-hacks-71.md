### Introduction to NUS Hackers

#### Talk Description:

As the title puts it, this talk will be about NUS Hackers – what we do and who we are. Come on down to find out more about us and what we can do for you!

#### Speaker Profile

Vishnu Prem is the current President of NUS Hackers, and has been heavily involved in the local hacking scene for a few years. He has also just completed his internship in Boston with Twitter. (Obviously, he's an active Twitter user – check him out [here](https://twitter.com/burnflare).)


### How to Level Up as a Developer: the Open Source Way

#### Talk Description:

Level up faster as a developer with this one weird trick! (Or two or more..)

Beng and Yang Shun will be sharing pointers and strategies on growing as a developer from their own experiences, and observations of others. These experiences come from working on open source projects, taking the killer modules in NUS, hackathons, etc.

#### Speakers' Profile

Eu Beng Hee (more commonly just known as Beng) and Tay Yang Shun are the developers behind [NUSMods](http://nusmods.com/).

Beng just graduated with a B.Comp. (Hons.) in Computer Science from NUS School of Computing and will be joining Google in August. He actually started university life with a double degree in Business and Computing in NTU, but transferred to NUS to concentrate solely on Computing. Beng founded NUSMods in 2012. More about him at [benghee.eu](http://benghee.eu).

Yang Shun started university life as a mechanical engineer. He got turned off by mechanical engineering modules and jumped ship after semester 1 of his second year. The turning point came when he took CS3217 in the semester after. He then went to Silicon Valley for a year as part of NOC, starting out as an iOS developer before becoming a front end web developer. Yang Shun later took CS3216 in semester 1 of his fourth year and served as Head Tutor for CS1010S. He joined NUSMods in 2014.
