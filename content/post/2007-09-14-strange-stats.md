Was just checking out our Google Analytics stats the other day and found a very interesting trend. Second to Singapore (of course), the highest number of incoming visitors to our <a href="http://opensource.nus.edu.sg">Opensource Wiki</a> are from.... USA!

The proof (darker areas show higher hits)

So anyway, just a big wave to our friends from the US! =D
