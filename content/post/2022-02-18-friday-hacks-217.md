## 1) How to build a Devtool startup in Silicon Valley

Are you curious what it takes to build a tech startup in Silicon Valley (SV)? Do you have an idea that will become the next unicorn?

Join me as we uncover the journey of creating the startup from 0 to 1! We will learn the technical and business challenges of turning an idea into a VC-funded startup - and how you can avoid mistakes that we made. We will also dive into the engineering decision-making process that led us to build out a full-fledged code editor in 3 months.
