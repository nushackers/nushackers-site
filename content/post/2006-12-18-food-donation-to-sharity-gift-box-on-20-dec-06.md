Hi everyone

Just read in today's papers that the Sharity Gift Box is still short of food item donations for needy households. We would like to organise a shopping outing to buy food items (such as rice, milo, etc) and drop them off at Ngee Ann City Sharity Gift Box on 20 Dec 06. That will be the last day for donations.

For those who cannot make it on the day, you are most welcome to donate any amount of money and we will do the rest. Donations can be sent via interbank transfer to POSB/DBS/UOB/MayBank accounts (email us for bank account details). We will keep all receipts and records of donations received for the sake of accountability.

Let's all do something meaningful and help the less fortunate this Christmas! If each of the 150 members in this list donates $10 (hardly enough for 2 fast-food meals), we will have $1500 to donate! That can buy us about 100 kilos of rice, or 150 tins of Milo!

All it takes from you is an email to contact @ linuxnus.org to register your interest to attend or donate! Include your contact number in the email. Do register your interest early because we have only 2 days left!
