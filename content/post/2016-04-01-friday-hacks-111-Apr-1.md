### Talk 1: The ABCs of XSS.

#### Talk Description:
Cross-site scripting is a very common computer security vulnerability usually found in web applications. XSS is a form of injection attack where it allows attackers to inject client-side scripts into web pages viewed by victims.

There are many different types of XSS, and although the common ones are known to many, there are variants which are less known. Quan Yang will be sharing about the different types of XSS, the common ones and the lesser known ones, along with many real-life examples of them.

#### Speaker Profile

Quan Yang is a year 3 Computer Science undergraduate at NUS, and is a co-founder of NUS Greyhats, the special interest group for Information Security in NUS.

### Talk 2: Just Hacker things with Jayson

#### Talk Description:

Instead of a usual talk where Jayson stands up and talks at you, this will be an open discussion. He will share several stories of his travels & exploits but mostly will be there to answer questions about hacking, blue team, red team and DEF CON Groups! So come with questions and expect a few answers and a lot of great hugs! üòâ
