## The Jane Street Estimathon®

The Estimathon® is a mind-bending mixture of math and trivia. In teams, you'll attempt 13 Fermi problems in 30 minutes, ranging from totally trivial to positively Putnam-esque. Be prepared to come up with the best set of confidence intervals! **Participants should bring a pen and paper with them.**

👋 See you there!
