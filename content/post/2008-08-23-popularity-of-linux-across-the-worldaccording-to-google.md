Ever wondered about the geographical popularity of Linux in a Windows dominated world?

Data (by popular search terms) from Google collated by <a href="http://royal.pingdom.com/?p=340">Royal Pingdom</a> reveals that Linux is more popular in the East and developing countries (probably due to cost?). Surprisingly, the United States isn't top 5 for any of the 8 distributions researched.

How about Singapore?

Well, according to <a href="http://www.google.com/insights/search/#cat=&q=linux&geo=SG&date=&clp=&cmpt=q">Google statistics</a>, search terms from Singapore involving Linux have sadly been declining since 2004 (which has also been true for many other countries).
