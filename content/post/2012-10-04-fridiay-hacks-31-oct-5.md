<h3>Talk 1: Andy Marks (of software consulting firm ThoughtWorks)</h3>
<strong>Talk Description:</strong>
Continuous Delivery is a 100% buzzword-compliant term used to describe the natural extension of Agile/Lean thinking into deployment of software. DevOps is a movement attempting to break down functional silos in organisations that need to deploy software. They are often used synonymously but the differences are far more subtle and subjective.

<strong>Speaker Profile:</strong>
Andy Marks is a 13-year veteran of ThoughtWorks and Technical Principal for the Singapore office, having previously been Market Technical Lead for the Melbourne and Perth offices in Australia. Andy has significant experience leading, coaching and working in Agile software development teams. In his various roles within ThoughtWorks, he has been involved in solution delivery, DevOps, continuous deployment on AWS platforms, coaching and mentoring team.

Andy is also the organiser for DevOps Singapore - a local meetup group that meets monthly to talk all things DevOps.
<h3>Talk 2: Building a telepresence robot (Sim Kai and Calvin Cheng,CtrlWorks)</h3>
<strong>Talk Description:</strong>
We will talk about the telepresence robot that we are working on, where we think the future is, and the technical challenges that we have encountered along the way.

<strong>Speaker Profile:</strong>
Kai used to work in the robotics team at ST Kinetics and has a keen interest to see how personal robotics can make a positive difference in everyday lives.

Calvin has more than 15 years experience working on large scale software systems at Yahoo, Sun, and Oracle. He is very interested in robotics because it bridges between our physical and virtual worlds.
