### Why Go For Go!

#### Talk Description:

The Go Programming Language - often referred to as GoLang - was launched by Google in 2007. Co-created by Ken Thompson (co-creator of Unix and creator of B, the predecessor to C), Rob Pike, and Robert Griesemer, Go has been growing in popularity year-after-year. 

We believe that there are good reasons for Go’s growing popularity and believe you should seriously consider it as the next programming language you learn. 

In this talk, we will cover the benefits provided by Go and why we like it for a range of problem domains, including microservice based architectures.
