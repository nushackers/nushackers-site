## 1) Project Sa'Bai Computing: Integrating Technology with Healthcare Services in Cambodia

Project Sa'Bai, an OCIP by NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, has improved Cambodian village healthcare since 2006 through annual screenings. In 2024, NUS Computing students collaborated with medical students to develop an EMR, serving 1,500+ patients in 7 days. This talk shares insights from leading Project Sa'Bai Computing, showcasing technology's role in frontline healthcare.

### Speakers Profile 🎙️️

David Goh, Ang Peng Xuan, and Isaac Ong oversaw the development of the EMR system for the trip. Since January 2024, they have led over 30 Computing students who contributed to the project throughout the year, coordinating efforts on the app alongside their studies and holidays. These efforts culminated in December 2024, when they led the team of 8 students was were responsible in ensuring the system was fully operational during the trip.<br /><br />
