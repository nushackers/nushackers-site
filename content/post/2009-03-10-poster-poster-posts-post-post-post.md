(Sorry about the title.) With the linuxNUS LXDE talk coming up, the linuxNUS Team has gone on a poster posting spree. Do keep a look out for our pretty LXDE poster around NUS! And if you haven't heard about the talk yet, <a title="Open up to Open Source: LXDE" href="http://linuxnus.org/2009/03/04/open-up-to-lxde/" target="_blank" title="Open up to Open Source: LXDE">check out the details</a> . If you catch this in time and want to come down, do <a href="http://linuxnus.org/registration/lxde">register</a> !

We had fun putting these posters up, and we'll hope you'll find the talk exciting and inspiring!

And here are some photos of us chilling out after putting up the posters at the NUS Arts Canteen.
