# Building side projects: the timeline, triggers and stages that every builder has to experience.

### Description

He's built a lot of things. From small web applications to desktop applications. From small libraries to browser add-ons. From basic demo projects to web-based multiplayer games. Some of his interesting projects include: [life](http://cheeaun.life/) (a timeline viewer), [hackerweb](https://cheeaun.github.io/hackerweb/) (a readable HackerNews web app) and [MooEditable](http://cheeaun.github.io/mooeditable/) (a simple web-based WYSIWYG editor). More of his projects [here](http://cheeaun.github.io/). More of his side projects adventures [here](http://cheeaun.com/blog/2016/01/building-side-projects/).

### Speaker Profile

Lim Chee Aun is a web developer from Malaysia, currently based in Singapore. He can design and code at same time, well, realistically one at a time. He dabbles around with mostly front-end technologies, always keeping up-to-date with the latest products, constantly learning new things and never stopping to build useful applications for himself and other people.
