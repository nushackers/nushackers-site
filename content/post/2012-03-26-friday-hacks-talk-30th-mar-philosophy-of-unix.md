<div>While Unix is best known as an operating system, the founding fathers of Unix developed it around an entire philosophy on how software should be developed. In this talk, Dr Brown will discuss the history leading up to the development of Unix as well as some of the underlying principles and practices that make up the Unix Philosophy.</div>
