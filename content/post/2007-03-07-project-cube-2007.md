The objective of Project Cube is to refurbish unwanted PCs for donation to Moral Home for the Disabled and Muhammadiyah Welfare Home. This project is spearheaded by NUSSU CBLC with linuxNUS as a supporting organisation.

For this project, 20 PCs will be donated to the beneficiaries. 10 of the PCs run <a href="http://www.zenwalk.org">Zenwalk Linux 4.4</a>. The other 10 run Microsoft Windows 98 and Free and Open Source Software such as Openoffice.org and Clam Antivirus.

Many thanks to James, Kheng Hui and Lu Feng from linuxNUS who have sacrificed much their free time to get Zenwalk installed and optimised for running 128MBram machines.

The trio have also written a supplement manual <a href="http://opensource.nus.edu.sg/wiki/index.php/Zenwalk">here</a>, which will be printed out and given to the beneficiaries.

The handing over of the PCs will take place on the 9th and 10th of March.
