So a small contingent from linuxNUS and NTUOSS <a href="//linuxnus.org/2009/03/17/singapore-linux-march-meetup-singapore-lubuntu-team/">headed down to the SLMG meetup</a>.  The meeting was soon called to order, and David and Darrel spearheaded the discussion about the draft of the constitution.

Some of the more interesting points raised was the type of voting proxy allowed. As geeks would have it, a seemingly never ending argument about proxy in writing, proxy via web conferencing, etc ensued. Thankfully, common sense prevailed and the meeting agreed that " (t)he Executive Committee, at its sole discretion, shall determine the validity of a proxy representation."

For full updates, do check out the <a href="//open-source-alliance.sg/FinalDraftConstitution">latest revised draft of the constitution of the Free and Open Source Alliance (Singapore) aka FOSA-SG</a>.

At the end of the discussion, Darrel updated that he has managed to partner up with National Library Board to secure the National Library for Software Freedom Day 09. Bravo!

We await to hear the inaugural committee upon inception of FOSA-SG as an official society.
