Hi everyone!

You've probably realized by now that we've got a <a href="/hack-and-roll/">24 hour hackathon</a> going on at COM1 Basement, on the 19th to 20th February (that's this Sunday to Monday).

We know that some of you can't join for a number of reasons - either you're too busy, or you're not sure you can build an app in 24 hours, or you have other things you need to do.

Well, we don't mind! 

<big>We'd like to <strong>invite you</strong> to come drop by at <strong>any time</strong> during the hackathon! Come work on your own programming projects, come see how people build apps from scratch, enjoy the environment, the intensity, the free food, and the free coffee! [2]</big>

<blockquote><strong>Time:</strong> 19 Feb (Sunday) 1pm - 20th Feb (Monday) 1pm
<strong>Venue:</strong> COM1 Basement 1
<strong>Agenda:</strong> Bring your laptop, a programming project and some headphones!
</blockquote>

And if you'd like, do come down to meet the judges and watch the conclusion of the Hackathon on Monday, at 12pm. We will have Erwan Macé from Google, Sarim Aziz from RIM, Professor Lee Wee Sun from SoC (plus two other judges we're awaiting confirmation from).

We hope to see you there!

<ul>
<li>Blackberry Playbook</li>
<li>Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000</li>
<li>Samsung Galaxy Ace</li>
<li>AWS Credits</li>
<li>Private Github Accounts</li>
<li>Free tickets to NUS Startup Weekend (worth $45 each)</li>
<li>Free tickets to e27's Echelon 2012 (worth $60 each)</li>
<li>Nokia Goodie Bags</li>
</ul>

[2] We're doing this because we want to have as many students as possible exposed to the idea that hacking is fun, is doable, and is beneficial for their future careers! So come join us!
