<a href="http://www.kroah.com/log/">Greg Kroah-Hartman</a>, one of the leading Linux kernel hackers has announced on his blog that his employer, Novell, <a href="http://www.kroah.com/log/linux/linux_driver_project_kickoff.html">has moved him</a> to work full-time on a project he <a href="http://www.kroah.com/log/linux/free_drivers.html">announced</a> back in January this year to help device manufacturers write free Linux drivers for their devices, so long as they provided the device specifications.

As Kroah-Hartman noted, after putting up his offer,
<blockquote> It turns out that there were two large groups of people who responded to the announcement, companies wanting drivers, and developers wanting to help out.</blockquote>
He was unable to cope with the workload, trying to juggle a full-time job and hacking the kernel on the side.

However, Novell recently modified his postion at work to allow Kroah-Hartman to work full time on the project, which will hopefully lead to more drivers being developed for Linux. Kroah-Hartman is the kernel maintainer for the PCI, USB, IÂ²C, driver core and the sysfs kernel subsystems, according to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Kroah-Hartman">his Wikipedia entry</a>.

We say, "Well Done, Novell!", and all the best Greg!
