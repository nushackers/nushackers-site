## 1) MiTM Magic: Outsmarting SSO and 2FA Defenses

In this talk, we explore how modern tech stacks that rely on SaaS applications behind Single Sign-On (SSO) service providers have become prime targets for attackers. We'll dive into how even advanced two-factor authentication (2FA) methods remain vulnerable to sophisticated Man-in-the-Middle (MiTM) phishing attacks and examine the bypass techniques that are evolving. Bonus: we'll put Google's defenses to the test with a live demonstration!
