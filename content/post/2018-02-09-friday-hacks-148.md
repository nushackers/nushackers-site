Hi hackers! This week we have Arun Sivakumar and Xyriz Tan who would be talking about making a mobile chatbots, 
as well as Lu Jiahui who would be talking about applying Machine Learning in UAV.

### Using Recurrent Neural Networks in Anomaly Detection of Failures in UAV

#### Talk Description:

Military exercises are an expensive affair, but they are absolutely necessary in order keep our army operationally ready. When a UAV fails during exercises, the fleet is grounded until investigation is completed. This affects the realism of training and is undesirable. To shorten the investigatory process, we implemented an anomaly detector using recurrent neural networks to tell investigators during what time did the UAV exhibited erratic behaviors so that they do not have to look for a needle in the haystack.

#### Speaker Profile
