You really should have been there. We had lots of fun! VMs were set up, guests shared stories, and we even had an 'unplugged' session... so to speak. It's OK if you didn't know what I'm talking about. ;)

If you couldn't make it down, but still want to get Linux on your computer, feel free to drop any of us a message on the Facebook group - we'll arrange something, maybe even an encore install fest!

Stay tuned for more events to come, we'll keep you posted!
