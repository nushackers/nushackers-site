From <a href="////www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=219542641712&amp;ref=ts">HackerspaceSG Christmas party Facebook page</a>
<blockquote><em>We are 1 month old, and we're celebrating it by throwing ourselves a Christmas Party! This event is similar to our open house party!</em>

<em>We'll be catering some halal food from around the area. If you can bring more food, that will be great! Just make sure it is halal, or if not, indicate it isn't.</em>

<em>Drinks will be available, including Wine, and some alcohol. As usual, contributions to our pot of donations will be appreciated.</em>

<em>We're also going to have a gift exchange in the form of a game. So bring some physical gift which cost no more than $15, wrap it up, hide it, and come up with clues! The smaller the gift, the easier to hide. *evil laughter* Oh and you don't have to bring a gift to attend the party, but you won't be able to play the game (I think??). :)</em>

<em>Join us for our party now!!!</em></blockquote>

<em><strong>Date: Friday, 18 Decemer 2009</strong></em>

<em><strong>Time: 19:00 - 23:55</strong></em>

<em><strong>Location: HackerspaceSG , 70A Bussorah Street, Singapore</strong></em>
