We've just started a new NUS Hackers Facebook Group!

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/465345730232669/" target="_blank">https://www.facebook.com/groups/465345730232669/</a>

The purpose of this new group is similar to our existing Google Group (groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/nushackers): For people to ask questions and share interesting things within our community.

<strong>Our goal as NUS Hackers is to build a healthy community of passionate hackers in NUS and Singapore.</strong> To that end, we hope that this new Facebook Group will provide a low-friction avenue for people within our community to share and interact.

We've realised from your feedback that our current mailing list can be quite intimidating, to the extent of being insular, and this discourages people from sharing and interacting with the community as much as we'd like.

We take your feedback very seriously and constantly try to improve the way we work. We'd love to hear from you.
