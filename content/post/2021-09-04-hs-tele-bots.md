This workshop will go through how to create a simple bot on Telegram.

We will go through the different use cases for bots, 3 common paradigms bots can follow, and then create example bots to understand these paradigms. All you need to attend this event is a laptop with wireless internet access and either Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox. Additionally, you need a Google and Telegram account.
