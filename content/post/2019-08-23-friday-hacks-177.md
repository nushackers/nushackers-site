### Project Intern

#### Talk Description:

Have you ever seen people going for tech internships all over the world? Wondering if you can get these internships as well?

Come to this session to find out why do internships and how you can get one yourself!

To the freshmen, it is never too late to start! Also learn what steps you can take to prepare yourselves for the internship process, such as the application, the resume, and the interview.

We will also be hosting a panel session, featuring a diverse set of people working in companies such as: local companies (Carousell, Grab, Sea), international big companies (Facebook, Google), some smaller companies (Stripe), trading companies (DRW, Jane Street, Jump Trading), startups, and even research!

Free pizza is served before the talks.
