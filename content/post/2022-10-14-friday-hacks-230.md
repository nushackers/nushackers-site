## 1) The Making of Precursor: AMA

[Precursor](https://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/?p=5921) is an open hardware platform for developing secure applications. The design is open-source from the CPU core to the metal case to the full-custom operating system, Xous. This talk will set the stage for the broader context of Precursor, touching on some of the more interesting challenges, while reserving a chunk of time for audience Q&A to deep-dive into facets that are of most interest to the attendees.
