This week, we will be adding a twist to our regular Friday Hacks. 
 
Instead of the regular talks by speakers, we'll just be having a hacking session. You are more than welcome to bring your own projects, homework, etc, down and join us!
 
In addition, this weeks Friday Hacks is themed:<br/>
<b>Getting Started with Open-Source</b>.

We will be spending the entire Friday Hacks helping students take their first steps in contributing to open-source projects. There will be members on standby to guide you along. This will be especially useful for students that are unfamiliar with open-source contributions but are interested in starting!

Those who are active contributors to open-source projects are welcome to join and guide the others as well.
 
As always, there'll be drinks, pizza and a fun crowd to mingle with.

We look forward to seeing you there!
 
*Tell us what you think about this alternative format of Friday Hacks :)
