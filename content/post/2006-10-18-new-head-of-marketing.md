Yoz! linuxNUS has a new Head of Marketing! Wee Biao aka Rey is coerced <a title="Lu Feng and Rey in our room" href="/res/2006/10/lufeng_and_rey.jpg"><img align="right" alt="Lu Feng (Left) and Rey (Right) in our room" id="image29" style="width: 72px; height: 96px" title="Lu Feng (Left) and Rey (Right) in our room" src="/res/2006/10/lufeng_and_rey.thumbnail.jpg" /></a> into this by none other than Lu Feng, he has graciously accepted his role.

Although his exact duties are not fixed yet (we don't really confine ourselves to our job scope anyway), his duties will most likely involve around publicising our events as well as marketing linuxNUS to likely sponsors.

Three cheers for Rey! Let's give him all our support.
