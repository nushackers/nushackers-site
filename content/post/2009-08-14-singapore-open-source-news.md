<a href="http://www.zdnetasia.com/news/software/0,39044164,62056390,00.htm">A piece about Open Source trends in Singapore</a>, which is <a href="http://www.zdnetasia.com/news/software/0,39044164,62056314,00.htm">part of a roundup on Open Source in Asia</a>.

And <a href="http://www.zdnetasia.com/news/software/0,39044164,62056569,00.htm">some snippets</a> from <a href="http://linuxnus.org/2009/07/27/red-hat-ceo-comes-to-singapore/">Red Hat CEO's recent address at SIM</a> .

Good to see Open Source in Singapre growing slowly but steadily.
