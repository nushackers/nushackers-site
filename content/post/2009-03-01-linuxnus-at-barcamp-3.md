Many of the the #linuxnus regulars had attended Barcamp 3 Singapore held at Ngee Ann Poly on 28 Feb.

It was really nice to be able to meet many irc peeps in real life face to face . More photos <a href="http://good-times.webshots.com/album/570375228zfseeF?vhost=good-times">here</a> courtersy of Mario :)

We were also fortunate to meet up with Mario Behling, the President of the LXDE Foundation. Mario is very interested in getting people interested in contributing to LXDE. Currently, linuxNUS is making plans to have Mario down at at NUS for a meetup. So stay tuned!
