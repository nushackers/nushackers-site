### Talk description

What exactly goes on in the commercial drone/UAV industry in Singapore and globally? Behind the hype of consumer “selfie” drones lies a vast number of interesting commercial applications, where drones become an enabler for enterprises to gain new aerial perspectives of their facilities and estates, to make intelligent decisions incorporating this additional dimension of data.

In this presentation, we will survey a number of such applications, reveal some of the behind-the-scene processes and technology platforms, and put on our thinking hats to design a solution for a hypothetical business need. We will also walk through some of the basics and upcoming technical challenges that the industry is looking for a better solution to, including both better hardware (mechanical design, sensors, network), and software (automation, geo-based systems, computer vision, and data analytics).
