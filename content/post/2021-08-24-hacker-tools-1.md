Welcome to Hacker Tools! This session, we'll be talking about virtual machines and their usage, and then putting it into practice by walking through the installation of Ubuntu in VirtualBox, a popular and open-source hypervisor.

Please download Ubuntu, and download and install VirtualBox beforehand, because the files may be large and will take a while to download:

- VirtualBox: [https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
- Ubuntu: [https://download.nus.edu.sg/mirror/ubuntu-releases/focal/ubuntu-20.04.2.0-desktop-amd64.iso](https://download.nus.edu.sg/mirror/ubuntu-releases/focal/ubuntu-20.04.2.0-desktop-amd64.iso)

Please also make sure you have virtualisation enabled in your system firmware. See this page for a guide: [https://archive.is/SLebO](https://archive.is/SLebO)

See you there!
