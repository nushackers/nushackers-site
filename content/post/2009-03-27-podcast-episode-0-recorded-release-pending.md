After some difficulty finding a recording venue and some hours of figuring out a reasonable setup, five linuxNUSers (icedwater, ruiwen, dqminh, aaronstevensonle, dwu) finally got around to recording the raw premier episode of the linuxNUS podcast. Discussed on the record were:
- why TCC Circular Road rocks (and Geek Terminal does not)
- past and future FOSS events in Singapore
- anything else geeks can come up with chatting over coffee

Discussed off the record were plans for future podcasts, format, style, and content. The podcasters plan on future interviews, a much better recording setup, and possibly even super-swoosh transitions and editing. Also, much goofing off ensued.

Editing of the episode is well under way, keep an ear out for the final cut :)
