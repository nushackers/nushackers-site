## 1) Why bet the company on Elm for both front and backend? (And how does that work?)

Although Elm usually runs on the browser, this talk explains why it's actually a great choice for building the backend too -- and why it can be a perfect choice for a startup. We will walk through how it even works on the backend, and how wonderful life can be in such an environment!
