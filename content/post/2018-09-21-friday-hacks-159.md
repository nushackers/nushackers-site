### PayPal: The Reactive Mindset

#### Talk Description:

Re-platforming of the technology stack is the norm in all software development organisations. Software practitioners explore and adopt various architectures and technologies during this process. Even if the task is to build out a brand new stack, what is often missing is the focus on changing the mindset of the entire team to adopt such technologies. This talk focuses on the reactive manifesto and various technologies available which provide a reactive approach to programming. Above all it focuses on the change in mindset required to adopt the reactive way of doing things.

### Carousell: Automate! Lazy is not bad.

#### Talk Description:

Before launching a feature or making change to an existing feature, Carousell’s product teams will carry out A/B experiments to test the feature or change. To decide if a feature/change has positive impact to the marketplace, we look at data and leverages on statistics to make decisions.

Our product data analysts are responsible in computing the experiment summary as well as design and build dashboard on the summary. After several experiments, we have found a pattern in the experimentation workflow of an analyst and have built an Experimentation Reporting Framework (ERF) to automate some part of the pattern.

Looker is the tool we are using for data visualization and reporting, and it is also the tool used for dashboarding on experiment summary. Today, we will be sharing how we make use of Looker’s API to automate dashboard building in ERF.
