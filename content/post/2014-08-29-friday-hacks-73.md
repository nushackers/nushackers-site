### Optimizing Underwater Modems and Other Hardware Fun!

#### Talk Description:

Shan will talk about the evaluation of various single board computers, analyze power consumption, and methods to reduce power draw when not needed. Shan will also talk about a total dissolved solids meter he designed and failed to scale up (so all you hardware folks don’t do the same mistakes). He’ll also give tips to help get you started with hardware, it isn’t that hard ;)

#### Speaker Profile

Shan, the self-confessed hardware geek, is currently working at Subnero. He loves to tinker with his arduino and tear open anything that guzzles electricity and/or held by nuts&bolts. Shan is also a staunch advocate of open source software.
