==============================================================
Every Linux user would have heard of Gnome or KDE. But there are a lot of other desktop environments too! Why don't you try out LXDE?

"Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment" (LXDE) is a fast, performance and energy saving desktop environment for Linux maintained by an international community of developers. It comes with a beautiful interface, multi-language support, standard keyboard short cuts, tabbed file browsing and more! Designed to use less CPU and less RAM, LXDE is especially suitable for hardware with low specifications like netbooks, mobile devices (e.g. MIDs) or older computers, providing a fast desktop experience.

Mario Behling, President of the LXDE Foundation, will share with local students on how to contribute to the LXDE Project on both the technical and non-technical aspects of the project. Don't miss out on this rare opportunity to meet the man himself during his stopover in Singapore!
