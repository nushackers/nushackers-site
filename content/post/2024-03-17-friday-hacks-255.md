## 1) Creating Prototypes that Prove a Point

This talk explores the process of designing and creating prototypes to validate hypotheses and illustrate key concepts. Through practical examples and insights, we will understand how prototypes serve as powerful tools to test ideas effectively and drive innovation forward.

## 2) ERP X: Road Charges, Reimagined

ERP X is an exploration of what road charging in Singapore could look like. The concept is simple: use roadside cameras to read license plate numbers, and inform drivers via a mobile app. Learn about how the team went through the process of exploring, designing and building the prototype in the span of a month. This product came from Hack for Public Good 2024, Open Government Product's annual hackathon.
