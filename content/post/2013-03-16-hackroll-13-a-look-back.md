Hack&amp;Roll, the 24-hour hackathon we started last year, was held for the second time around on the 24<sup>th</sup> and 25<sup>th</sup> of February, in the NUS School of Computing COM1 Basement. This year saw an even larger turnout than last time, with 62 participants competing in 22 teams, as well as a number of non-participants who came down to enjoy the ambiance and work on their own.

After working through the night (fuelled by a large supply of snacks and drinks), the teams presented their work to each other and the panel of judges: Dinesh and<b> </b>Brian from Palantir Technologies, Professor Lee Wee Sun from NUS SOC, Ruiwen and Luther from Hackerspace SG, and Justin from BlackBerry.

<strong>First prize</strong> was taken by Team SigLabs, who built an open source converter between Latitude/Longitude and SVY21 (<a href="https://github.com/cgcai/SVY21">https://github.com/cgcai/SVY21</a>), a geodetic datum used here in Singapore. Their efforts earned each member an all-expense-paid trip to Silicon Valley (courtesy of Palantir Technologies), a new BlackBerry Z10, and a one year GitHub Small Account.

Team Chunky Bar developed an augmented reality mobile game where the object was to launch objects at “coworkers” in a virtual office. This earned him <strong>second prize</strong>, a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t32FpHt5yH4" target="_blank">Parrot A.R. Drone 2.0</a>, a BlackBerry Z10, and a one year GitHub Small Account.

Participants voted for their favourite project after all presentations were made, and the<b> Popular Choice</b> spot prize went to him as well – a Raspberry Pi Model B.

Third prize went to Team RedBull, who built a WiFi-enabled space tracker (<a href="https://github.com/soulslicer/RoomTraq">https://github.com/soulslicer/RoomTraq</a>) which recorded how many people entered or left a given area. He was given an MK808 Dual-Core USB Computer.

There were also several spot prizes given out to teams the judges felt particularly deserved them. The <b>Best Freshmen Effort</b> prize went to Team Nange, who built a web app (<a href="https://github.com/yyjhao/NUSMorge">https://github.com/yyjhao/NUSMorge</a>) that hooked into NUSMods to show overlaps and free spots between different timetables. Each member was given an Arduino Leonardo.

The <b>Most Awesomely Useless</b> award (created to reward the team whose product best embodied the spirit of “hacking for the sake of hacking”) went to Team Infinite Loop, who developed a facial recognition system to control an RC car. For this, they walked away with a Neocube each.

We’d like to thank all our sponsors (including Palantir Technologies, BlackBerry, and PayPal, to name a few), and especially everyone who came down to either participate or simply hang out – Hack&amp;Roll simply couldn’t have been possible without you.

We have a series of write-ups that'll go up over the next few weeks, written by participants: these give a description of what they worked on and came up with during the event. Do look out for them!

We hope to see you again next year!
