We are back with our Hackfest and this time our venue is Redhat Office!

All the hacker/geeks/enthusiasts are invited to attend the linuxNUS Hackfest!

At linuxNUS Hackfests, youre free to work on whichever development project you want to, be it anything ranging from Linux to Android to Facebook. Or you can just collaborate with others on their projects. Look out for the one that interests you.

Importantly, you get to meet and interact with other hackers, and hopefully everyone gets to pass a little knowledge around. The more knowledge is shared, the more everyone benefits! Isnt that great!

Date: <strong>14th November, Saturday</strong>
Venue: <strong>RedHat Office</strong>
8 Shenton Way #10-00, Singapore 068811
Timing: <strong>1pm to 6pm</strong>
