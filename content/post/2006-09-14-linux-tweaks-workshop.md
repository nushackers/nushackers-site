Linux documentation isn't the easiest to find in NUS. And the helpdesk may only support *GASP* Win****.

Why depend on the helpdesk at all? Right here in NUS is the <a href="//linuxnus.org/?page_id=6">linuxNUS community</a>.

You may have just installed Linux. Or maybe you have used Linux for eons. Or perhaps you just want to try your hand at installing Linux.

Come to the Linux Tweaks Workshop. Share your configurations and hacks, or pick up a tip or two from others.

All the sharing will be accumulated on <a target="_blank" href="//opensource.nus.edu.sg">Opensource@NUS</a> portal.

Be part of this <a href="//linuxnus.org/?page_id=6">community</a> event.

Be there.
