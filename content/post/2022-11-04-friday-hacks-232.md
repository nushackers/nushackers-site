## 1) Graphs at Scale: Powering Google Maps, Drug Discovery, and Recommendation Systems with Graph Deep Learning

Everything around you can be represented as a graph! Understanding the relationships between different interacting entities opens up a world of opportunities. With awesome applications in Commerce, Healthcare, Finance, Transportation, Manufacturing, and Social Networks, ‚ú®Graph Deep Learning ‚ú® has risen in popularity over the past 3 years. Graph Neural Networks offer an interesting way of learning over graph-structured data to predict who you can follow ü§ù, the best chemicals for a drug üíä, travel time from home to school üöï, and what you're going to watch next üì∫. Through colourful diagrams and simple analogies, I distill what's happened so far in the field and chat about what's to come.
