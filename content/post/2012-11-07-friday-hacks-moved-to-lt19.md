Due to incredible demand, this week's Friday Hacks (9th November) with Quora recruiting and Winston Teo has been moved to LT19, next to the Business Canteen. Here's a map to the new location: <a href="http://bit.ly/nus-lt19" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/nus-lt19</a>

The easiest way to get to LT19 is to drop off at the School of Computing bus stop, enter COM2, and then walk through the business canteen. The lecture theatre is located directly opposite the COM2 entrance.

Over 100 people have registered. This event is open to the public.

As a reminder, the talk starts promptly at 7pm. Food will be served after the two talks have concluded.
