This week's Friday Hacks will be held at the Global Learning Room at the Education Resource Centre in UTown. Details are as follows:

<blockquote>Location: UTown, Education Resource Center, 2nd floor, <strong>Global Learning Room</strong>
 Time: 7pm-10pm
Agenda: Informal talk by Vinnie Lauria (he says he'd love it if it were mostly QnA), and informal hacking.
</blockquote>

We'll be having Vinnie Lauria (@vlauria) from SV (Silicon Valley) speaking on the upcoming <a href="http://superhappydevhouse.sg/">SuperHappyDevHouse</a> that he's helped to bring from SV, as well as on hacking and entrepreneurship. Vinnie sold his startup Lefora.com not too long ago, and is now touring Asia (as well as checking Singapore's startup scene).

Like James' talk on PCB fab last week, it'll be an informal session, so people who want to hack may do so at the back of the room.

We will also be doing a round of quick intros and what you're planning on working on at the start of the session. See you there!
