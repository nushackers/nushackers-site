Hi guys!

The details of the install fest are finally out! Come to

SOC1 #03-17 on Thursday, Feb 5, at 6.30pm

with your laptops! We'll be providing Ubuntu 8.10 liveCDs you can keep. Do back up your extra-precious stuff before coming yeah? Most of the time, things will be fine, but we want to be sure nothing (as far as possible) goes wrong.

If you know where the linuxNUS room is, you'll know where to turn up... it's just across the corridor :) If you like you can hang out with us for dinner afterwards as well.

RSVP at contact@linuxnus.org or send SMS to Kheng Hui (91804777).
