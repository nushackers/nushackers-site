For all of you who're interested in trying out Ubuntu for the first time, NUS Computing Club and Ubuntu.SG have teamed up with us to present the next instalment of our Open up to Open Source series, imaginatively titled Ubuntu. (Sorry!)

Read <a href = "//ubuntu.sg/UbuntuWorkshop_NUS">about the event</a> on the Ubuntu.SG site. While registration for this event is closing soon because of limited places in  Programming Lab 2, we'd like to get a sense of how many people would like to attend such an event if we were to hold another.

We are also considering a slightly more advanced workshop sometime in the near future with, again in collaboration with Ubuntu.SG,  but that really depends on the response from this event's participants. Anyone who has Ubuntu already installed on their computers and would like to hang out with us to swap tips or learn more, send email to our <a href = "mailto:linuxnus@yahoogroups.com?subject=Ubuntu">Yahoo group</a> or keep in touch via our <a href = "//www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=4901204841">Facebook group</a> (just search linuxNUS).
