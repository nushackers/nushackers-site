In the jargon of the computer programmer, a hacker is someone who strives to solve problems in elegant and ingenious ways.

NUS Hackers is a student-run organization committed to the spread of hacker culture and free, open source software. We provide a support system for hackers in NUS who are currently building things, be it for charity, business or pleasure. We also hold workshops, run technical meetups, organize hackathons, and maintain open source code for the NUS community.

## What we do

During the semester, our primary events include

- weekly meetups every Friday called [Friday Hacks]({{< ref "/fridayhacks" >}}) that include one or two technical talks, sometimes followed by a hacking session;
- workshops on Tuesdays called [Hackers Toolbox]({{< ref "/hackerstoolbox" >}}) (formerly Hacker Tools) that cover skills that are essential to those in computing fields but are not usually taught by schools; and
- workshops on Saturdays called [Hackerschool]({{< ref "/hackerschool" >}}) that cover a range of technical topics, and are aimed at introducing technologies to those who have no prior knowledge.

Near the start of each calendar year, we also run [Hack&amp;Roll](https://hacknroll.nushackers.org/), the largest student-run hackathon in Singapore. Hack&Roll is unique for being one of the few hackathons, if not the only, that do not have a set topic for participants; instead, the aim is to simply encourage people to come and have fun building something.

We also run smaller events for the NUS community, like Project Intern, where students who have interned share with others their experience and the benefits they have gained from interning, in a bid to encourage others to intern. Once in a while we also initiate other events like [OpenHack](https://openhack.nushackers.org). Everything we do is ultimately aimed at spreading the hacker culture.

Some of our events are recorded if consent is given by the relevant parties. Find our recordings [here]({{< ref "/recordings" >}}).

Participants at our events must follow our [event code of conduct]({{< ref "/conduct" >}}).

## Philosophy

We believe that hacking is necessary for good innovation. (In fact, the best computer-related startups and technologies [have all come from hackers]({{< ref "/why" >}}).) As an extension to that, we think tinkering is win-win-win: you learn new things, you get to show off, and you become more attractive to employers.

(Though, honestly, most of the time we hack because it's fun.)

## Goal

Our long term goal is to build a healthy community of passionate hackers in NUS. We think that this benefits everyone: professors benefit because they are able to source for good programmers; startups and tech companies benefit because they are able to recruit from a central pool; and students benefit because they get to meet and learn from like-minded peers (and get opportunities from professors and tech companies).

## Coreteam

NUS Hackers is managed by a coreteam of student volunteers. You can reach us by [email]({{< ref "/contact" >}}). Want to help us in spreading hacker culture? [We want you!]({{< ref "/join-coreteam" >}})
