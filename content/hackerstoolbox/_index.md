Through your education, you'll probably take many Computer Science courses that teach you complex topics like algorithms, machine learning, software engineering, operating systems and more.

However, they typically miss out on an important topic that has a huge impact on whether you can apply this knowledge in your work: expertise in the tools you use. During your courses, you'll probably spend long amounts of time using your shell, version control, text editors, etc. so being able to use them efficiently and effectively is incredibly useful.

Inspired by [The Missing Semester of Your CS Education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu) series from MIT, we'll cover these topics in a fun and interactive workshop setting. By the end of each workshop in Hackers Toolbox, you'll gain practical skills and a deep understanding of a new tool!
