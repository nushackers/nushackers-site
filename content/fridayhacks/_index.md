Our weekly Friday meetups are called Friday Hacks. They include one or two technical talks, sometimes followed by a hacking session. Through Friday Hacks, we hope to get people to come share their hacks, research, or technical knowledge with the technical community in NUS.

We have up to 2 talks at each session, with each talks being about 30&ndash;45 minutes long. Dinner is always served (usually pizza). Food is served at 6:30pm and talks start at 7pm.

We also record the talks if the speaker consents. Find our recordings [here]({{< ref "/recordings" >}}).

## Speaker FAQ

**When and where do Friday Hacks happen?**
Friday Hacks happen every Friday at 6:30pm, at [Seminar Room 2 (02-04), Level 2, COM 1, University Town, National University of Singapore](https://goo.gl/maps/Xr8eEun83y4rJ6Zu8) unless otherwise stated.

**How do I get there from outside campus, and where can I park?**
If you plan to take public transportation, you may go to the various MRT stations such as Clementi, Kent Ridge MRT, and Buona Vista. Directions to NUS SoC can be found [here](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/maps/getting-here/). 

If you are driving, the nearest parking lots in SoC for visitors are [CP 11](https://goo.gl/maps/dqSuQawf7HBTsjck6) and [CP 15](https://goo.gl/maps/fMQziaoD6xmTnMFs7).
Staff season holders may park at [CP 13](https://goo.gl/maps/AoikKtXfuFh7yDrE7), which is right outside COM 1.

**Who is welcome to speak?**
Anyone! We do give some preference to NUS students, staff and professors, but we regularly invite speakers from all parts of the industry.

**Who has given a Friday Hacks talk?**
We've had speakers from Google, Quora, Palantir, Thought Works, Pivotal Labs, Nokia, Carousell, and Viki, amongst many others.

**What time should speakers arrive?**
People start streaming in at 6pm, but Friday Hacks are informal, so anytime between 6pm&ndash;7pm is okay. The actual event starts at 7pm.

**What topic should I talk about?**
Technical topics, of course! Talking about a weekend hack project, your research, or some ideas you recently had about tech are all great topics for a Friday Hacks talk. _The more code you show, the better!_ Note though that you should **not** give a recruiting pitch. We find that people are more receptive to pitches given at the tail end of technical talks.

**What's the audience like?**
Anyone is welcome to attend Friday Hacks, though our audience is primarily NUS School of Computing students. From experience, we expect 30&ndash;50 students on average at every weekly meeting.

**What tools are provided?**
We have a Windows desktop, a projector with VGA, a large whiteboard, and wireless network access. Let us know in your email if you need anything else and we'll see what we can do.
