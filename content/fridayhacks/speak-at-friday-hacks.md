### If you're working on something cool, you should come give a talk!

The fastest way to do so is to [send us an email](/contact). To help us out, remember to include the following information:

*   Your full name & professional affiliation or title (if you have one)
*   Title of your talk.
*   Date you want to speak.

Remember to check [this semester's schedule](/fh) and pick an available slot.
