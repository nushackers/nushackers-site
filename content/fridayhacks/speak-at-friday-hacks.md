### If you're working on something cool, you should come give a talk!

* Your full name & professional affiliation or title (if you have one)
* Title of your talk.
* Date you want to speak.

Remember to check [this semester's schedule]({{< ref "/fridayhacks/schedule" >}}) and pick an available slot.
