### In Support of Git

We use GitHub to store and share our code. GitHub, in turn, is powered by Linus Torvalds' Git - a <em>distributed</em> version control system. If you don't know how to use Git, and you're interested in learning it, there is an excellent tutorial from GitHub: <a href="https://try.github.io">https://try.github.io</a>. We also organize a git workshop every semester, together with other workshops on web development: <a href="//school.nushackers.org">//school.nushackers.org</a>.
