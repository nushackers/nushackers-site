We manage an <a href="https://github.com/nushackers/">nushackers git repository on github.com</a>. It contains things like <a href="https://github.com/nushackers/nushackers-site">source code of this web site</a> and <a href="https://github.com/nushackers/hackerschool">source code of our hackerschool website</a>. Free feel to clone/fork any of those or, even better, send us pull requests!

If you are a NUS student/staff, we also have a repository for your projects: [//code.nushackers.org](//code.nushackers.org) - use it to showcase your work! After doing so, you are welcome to <a href="/contact/">contact us</a> if you want us to maintain and publicize your code!
