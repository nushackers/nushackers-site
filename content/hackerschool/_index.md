We learn with two core premises
- Learning is hard
- Learning **alone** is *really* hard

**hackerschool** teaches basic, supplementary skills that are good to know, and not always covered in school. We hope to make learning these skills easier by getting people past the initial hurdle through workshops and classes.

## Our Goal

Though we are starting small with only a few courses, we have a **big** ambition. The hope is to ultimately have a comprehensive list of workshops that all students can look forward to and take part in.
