If you want to get in touch with us, feel free to send us a message via our email `coreteam [at] nushackers [fullstop] org`

This is ideal for things like: you’d like to request a workshop, you’d like us
to maintain some code, you’d like to do a guest post on our site, you have
further questions about our membership and organization. For general discussion,
or to interact with community members, we recommend you go to our [Discussion page](http://nushackers.org/discussion/).

__Note: If you’re about to contact us to ‘hack’ into a system, don’t bother:__ we’ll
report you to the relevant authorities, and may choose to shame you on our blog.
We’re a hacker organization, not a cracker organization. Know the [difference](http://nushackers.org/hackerdefined/).
