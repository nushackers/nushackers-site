### Deep Learning

#### Talk description

If you've come across the term deep learning before and have been hearing about how we're going to get Skynet soon, this talk will let you in on a little bit more of the details: How it works, where it's being used, the history of some of its development in the past, and why Elon Musk is horribly wrong about it killing us in the future ... the near future anyway.

#### Speaker profile

Shawn is an NUS Hackers alumnus, currently working as a research assistant in the NUS speech recognition group. He previously worked as a data janitor at Semantics3 in San Francisco.
