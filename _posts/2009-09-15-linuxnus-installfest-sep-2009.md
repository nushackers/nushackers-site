linuxNUS is hosting an Installfest at on 17 Sep 2009, Thursday, 745pm, at <a href="http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/aboutsoc/location.shtml">COM1 SR2</a>.

During this community building event, people get together to do mass/Free installations of Linux Operating System and other open source software. The event is open to everyone, from the complete newbie to the expert. Novices can bring their computers along and learn from experienced users in Installation and troubleshooting problems.

Through this event, linuxNUS hopes to strengthen and build the community of Linux and Open Source users in NUS and Singapore.

For the purposes of instruction and coordination, the session will focus on the installation of Ubuntu 9.04. However, users are free to try their hand at installing other distributions during the event. Please bring the Ubuntu Live CD given out at the Welcome Tea, if you already have one as limited CDs will be provided at the event. You can download the ISO file from an <a href="http://ftp.science.nus.edu.sg/linux/ubuntu-ISO/9.04/">NUS mirror</a> and burn the image with CD burning software such as <a href="http://infrarecorder.org/">InfraRecorder</a>.

If you are interested to attend the event, please kindly RSVP at <a href="http://linuxnus.org/register/installfest">http://linuxnus.org/register/installfest</a> so that we can estimate the headcount for light refreshments.
