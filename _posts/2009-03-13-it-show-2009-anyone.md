Hello everyone!

Now that the IT Show is on, is anyone out there intending to pop down to check out the deals this season?

Well if you happen to find yourself with a free Friday evening (14 Mar), why not join a few of us heading down to the IT Show at Suntec? The more the merrier!

Interested? Then catch up with the linuxNUS gang at 645pm, at Station Control of the City Hall MRT.

Just keep an eye for anyone with a laptop running Linux! Our dearest Luther will be bring his blue lenovo laptop and will be running on LXDE :)

Do reply here if you wanna join us!
