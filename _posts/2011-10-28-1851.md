<div>Notice: the NUS Hackers site continues to be black for this week. Last week, just as we were about to change it back, we received news of another passing - John McCarthy.</div>
<blockquote>
<div><strong>Time</strong>: 7.30-10.00</div>
<div><strong>Location</strong>: University Town, ERC, Seminar Room 3</div>
<div><strong>Agenda</strong>:</div>
<div>In memory of John McCarthy, father of Lisp and AI pioneer, we'll be having a short introduction to Scheme, a dialect of Lisp. Anyone who's well-versed with Lisp stuff (Common Lisp, Clojure, S-expressions, continuations) are welcome to share.</div></blockquote>
