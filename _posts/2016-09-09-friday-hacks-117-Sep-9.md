### Programs that Play better than Us

How do programs play games at the level of the best human players and beyond?
From Checkers to Chess and now Go, the ability of game playing programs have
improved dramatically from a combination of clever algorithms and faster
hardware. This talk is an introduction to the state of game playing algorithms
and future challenges

This talk is based on Melvin's experience developing Magarena, an AI that
plays Magic: The Gathering

### Accessibility and ChromeLens
