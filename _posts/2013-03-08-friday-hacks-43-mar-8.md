<h3>Talk 1: Arduino, Applied Science, and the Internet. (Nick Jachowski, PhD student in Geography)</h3>

<strong>Talk Description:</strong>
This talk will describe the step-by-step development of an open-source wireless sensor network which utilizes the Arduino platform. The sensor network was made in the context of applied environmental science, but it can be used for a variety of wireless sensing applications. In addition, the system incorporates internet connectivity to allow for real-time data streaming on the web. This talk will cover the basics of hardware engineering and design in addition to the various levels of coding required to interface with the hardware and with the internet.

<strong>Talk Prep:</strong>
This talk will explain the basics so no prior knowledge is necessary, but you may want to read the wikipedia entry on Aduino if you don't know what it is. 

<strong>Speaker Profile:</strong>
Nick is part programmer, part engineer and part scientist. He likes to make things - both in the computer world and the real world. Most of things he makes are related to applied environmental science. Currently, he is in his third year of the NUS PhD program in Physical Geography where his research focuses on coastal ecosystems modeling.

<h3>Talk 2: Silicon Valley: A hacker's perspective (Derrick Ko, Kicksend Employee #1)</h3>

<strong>Talk Description:</strong>
Derrick will be taking questions from the floor about tech and the tech scene in Silicon Valley and Singapore.

<strong>Speaker Profile:</strong>
Derrick a full-stack software engineer living in San Francisco.

He is currently work at Kicksend as employee #1. Prior to that, He was a consultant at Pivotal Labs, and founded a startup in Singapore.
