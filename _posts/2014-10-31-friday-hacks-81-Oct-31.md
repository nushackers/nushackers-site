### In Murphy('s Law) We Trust

#### Talk Description:

Mark will share about the problems encountered while scaling Viki's backend. More specifically, the talk will focus on problems caused by assumptions made while writing code (e.g. network, OS, etc).

#### Speaker Profile

Mark is part of Viki's Platform team at Viki, responsible for the backend serving Viki's various clients (iOS, Android, Web). While maintaining systems behind Viki API, he realized there are false assumptions software engineers tend to make, and seeks to point them out before it's too late.
