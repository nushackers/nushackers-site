<h3>Talk: Java Coding for Performance (Lee Chuk Munn - NUS)</h3>
<strong>Talk Description:</strong>
Abstraction is very important when writing software. However, even though highly abstracted programs are easier to understand and write, many times they ignore the underlying implementation, and as a result the performance of the program suffers. This talk will tell you how to fine-tune your Java code for the mission critical parts of your program.

<strong>Speaker Profile:</strong>
Chuk is with the Advanced Technology Applications Practice for National University of Singapore, Institute of Systems Science (NUS-ISS). His current responsibilities includes developing courseware, and teaching graduate and public courses in enterprise software engineering, software architecture, web technologies and enterprise Java.

Prior to joining ISS, Chuk works for Oracle and Sun Microsystems where his main responsibilities includes helping customers and partners across all industries in the APAC region, to develop, size and tune applications deployed to Java EE Application Servers. 

Chuk has more than 20 years of working experience and more than 30 years of developing and debugging software.

His interest includes peer-to-peer networks, application frameworks, Java Virtual Machine and dynamic languages. He keeps himself busy by contributing to various open source projects.
