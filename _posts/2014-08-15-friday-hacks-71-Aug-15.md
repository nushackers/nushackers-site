### Introduction to NUS Hackers

#### Talk Description:

As the title puts it, this talk will be about NUS Hackers – what we do and who we are. Come on down to find out more about us and what we can do for you!

#### Speaker Profile

Vishnu Prem is the current President of NUS Hackers, and has been heavily involved in the local hacking scene for a few years. He has also just completed his internship in Boston with Twitter. (Obviously, he's an active Twitter user – check him out [here](https://twitter.com/burnflare).)


### How to Level Up as a Developer: the Open Source Way

#### Talk Description:

Level up faster as a developer with this one weird trick! (Or two or more..)

We’ll be sharing pointers and strategies on growing as a developer from our own experiences, and observations of others. These experiences come from working on open source projects, taking the killer modules in NUS, hackathons, etc.

#### Speakers' Profile
