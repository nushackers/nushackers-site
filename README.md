# nushackers-site

Sup! This is the source code of the nushackers blog site http://nushackers.org.
Development blog site at https://nushackers.netlify.com

## Requirement

This website is built with hugo, so if you want to make changes to the templates or structures of the site, please first read about [hugo](https://gohugo.io/overview/introduction/). But if you are just going to modify the data or update/add a post, you can simply follow the guide below.

## Getting started

It's recommended that you test the site locally before doing any push. To do so, first install [hugo v0.24]("https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases") and [node lts](https://nodejs.org/en/).

Then enter this folder and run

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Hugo will now generate the site and watch the directory and update the site when any changes are made. You can access the site at `http://localhost:4000`

## Updating data

First, since hugo uses [yaml]("http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML") as the markup for data. It's really simple, so just read about it first.

With some knowledge of yaml, you can take a look at the `content` folder - it contains the data for displaying the Friday hacks in the index page, coreteam members in the `/about` page and coreteam alumni in the `/alumni` page. More details below:

In data, `friday_hacks.yml` is for the Friday hacks (duh!). It contains a list (under `hacks`) of objects each with four fields: `speaker`, `from`, `title` and `venue`. Leave the `speaker` field empty to mark it as 'slot is open', or fill it up if it's filled up. For special occasion such as holidays, delete all fields and put `nohack` as the sole field with the reason as the value, e.g.

```yml
- nohack: Good Friday
```

It also contains a field `start_date` which should be the date-time of the first Friday hack.

`coreteam_members.yml` is for the coreteam member info in `/about`. It contains again a list with objects each with 2 fields: `name` and `description`, so just fill that up. The first guy or gal should be the president.

`alumni.yml` is in the same format as `coreteam_members.yml`. So **to move a coreteam member to alumni, just cut and paste the entry into `alumni.yml`**

## Updating posts

About writing posts: https://gohugo.io/content/

If you are write those generic posts about Friday hacks, please use the script  `scripts/gen_fh.py` - yep, it's in Python yay! So install Python first. You can then use pip to install the packages in requirements.txt.

To use the script, first make sure you have filled up the Friday hacks entry in `data/friday_hacks.yml`, then just run it.

```bash
$ cd scripts
$ python gen_fh.py
```

It will ask for you name (as the author), and generates the md file in `post/content`. Now go ahead and add in more details to the post.

## Final words

If you dislike any parts of this website, just clone it and push your changes! Make sure you update `README.md`, though, or the octopus will be really pissed off.
