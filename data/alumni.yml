  - name: Shan
    description: |
      a Computer Science undergraduate. He can almost always be spotted engulfed

      powered up, he would either be tearing it apart to figure out how it works,
      or to hack it to make it faster, better and more useful! Zealous about
      stargazing and classical music. Just to name a couple of facets that make up
      Shan!
