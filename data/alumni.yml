  - name: Shan
    description: |
      a Computer Science undergraduate. He can almost always be spotted engulfed
      in either his Android or his laptop. He is an advocate of open source
      software, and swears by Linux. If not currently engaged by a gadget that is
      powered up, he would either be tearing it apart to figure out how it works,
      or to hack it to make it faster, better and more useful! Zealous about
      stargazing and classical music. Just to name a couple of facets that make up
      Shan!
